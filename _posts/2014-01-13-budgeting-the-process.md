Often, budgeting is made to seem a lot more difficult or complex than it is in reality. Hopefully this will simplify the process for you and provide a base for you to begin budgeting. This is not the whole story by any means and, you will find, once you start budgeting, you develop your own budgeting style that works for you and allows you to manage and control your money better than you ever have before.

### When life gives you lemons

The first step to really understanding your money is to take a step back from the day-to-day of working and spending and shift your perspective a little bit. Think about a business &#8211; a lemonade stand. There are obviously costs to doing business; our lemonade stand has to buy lemons, sugar, cups, a jug and general stand maintenance. To effectively manage our lemonade stand we need to plan our output, gather our ingredients, set our prices, and only then make and sell lemonade. The problem generally with budgeting is we focus on and move to the last step “make and sell” (work and spend) without the necessary preparations.

So we start to plan our output &#8211; how many glasses of lemonade do we expect to produce, how much of each ingredient is required and what is the cost? This is our budget. It’s only an estimate since we haven’t made any lemonade yet but we are thinking about and, importantly, planning for the future.

After planning, we need to actually spend in order to gather our ingredients. In a perfect world, we will spend exactly what we have planned for &#8211; but the world is never perfect. Instead we spend more on lemons than we expected because of a recent rise in the price. Importantly, the business doesn’t grind to a halt just because we spent more than we expected, instead we press on to the next stage.

The next stage is to set our prices, where we review our actual expenses (not our planned expenses) and calculate the cost per glass. If it costs $1 per glass to make our lemonade, we decide to charge $2 so we make a tidy profit.

But hold on, we were talking about budgeting! Of course as households we don’t operate as profit driven businesses but that doesn’t mean we ignore this step. This step, when applied to a household budget, is the stage of review. This is where you compare your budgeted and actual expenses to see if you achieved your plan. If not, you have the chance to make changes for next time &#8211; you use your actual expenses to inform your plan for next time.

### Step by step

Start by estimating or calculating all sources of income. Then make an estimate of your monthly expenses. Try to include all the categories you spend money on, even if that expenditure is less frequent than monthly. You want to budget for all known costs so when the expense falls due, you have saved a sufficient amount to cover the whole expense.

The <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/" target="_blank">ASIC MoneySmart</a> website has a great <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools/budget-planner" target="_blank">budget planner</a> which will help you to identify categories within your budget so you hopefully don’t miss anything. It will also calculate any weekly or fortnightly expenses into a monthly amount for you (or vice versa) depending on how frequently you set your budget. This tool will also help you to calculate your surplus or deficit. Hopefully your income exceeds your expenses and you result in a surplus, but a deficit is fine too. What’s important is that you are capturing your situation. We will look at strategies for handling surpluses and deficits later on.

Now you must track your actual spending over the month. This involves keeping receipts and statements and categorising your expenses (using the same categories you used to set your budget). You can track your spending with pen and paper or <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools/mobile-apps/trackmyspend" target="_blank">using an app</a>. It doesn’t matter how sophisticated this process is, as long as it works for your. The more easily you can track your spending, the more likely you will actually do it. And something that you can develop in to a habit that you do every day will certainly help too.

Now you should have a record of all your spending in the last month and your plan for your spending (your budget) that you set at the start of the month. By comparing the two you can see how accurate your estimates were and this then feeds into your next month’s budget, allowing you to adjust your planned expenditure.

We will look at overspending later on and ways that you can manage it effectively, but for the time being, the important point is to note the difference between your planned and actual expenditure. Budgeting is all about providing useful information &#8211; feedback to you. For those who don’t budget this way, their spending goes unchecked and they don’t have the information necessary to change their behaviours. Only with information can you adjust your spending, adjust your expectations and confirm that you have been successful.

The most important step is reviewing and adjusting your budget and most people avoid this step. This is where you have to make those tough decisions so it’s understandable that it is neglected. But without review, the budget becomes useless and any information or insights that you can gain from your budget are being lost &#8211; simply because you might find it uncomfortable to look at. Those uncomfortable feelings can be mitigated if you have strategies to deal with any overspending (or splurges) which we will discuss soon.
