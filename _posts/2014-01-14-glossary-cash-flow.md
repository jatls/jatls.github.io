### Income

Income is fairly obviously the money you receive from various sources whether that be work or investments. While the concept of income in personal finance is fairly simple, managing it can be difficult.

#### Passive Income

This is income where you haven’t traded labour for money but instead used your assets to work for you. Examples would include rent from an investment property or dividends from a share portfolio. Both of these will generate income without you having to physically exert yourself.

Passive income is preferable over earned income since if you can grow an investment portfolio that earns enough income to cover all your lifestyle expenses then you can live indefinitely on those returns without having to worry about employment. This is the dream most people chase when they wish to be rich but it is difficult to achieve. A more realistic goal is to earn *some* passive income to supplement your employment income. And of course once you have a little passive income, it is easier to reinvest that income to further grow your wealth.

#### Earned Income

This is your cash wages that you receive in exchange for your time or labour. This is the most common source of income and most apparent (especially when your pay cheque is received).

### Expenses

From an accounting perspective, an expense represents the usage of economic benefits and so is linked to a particular asset (reducing it) or liability (increasing it). This is fairly intuitive if you consider a shopping trip. When you pay for your shopping you either pay cash (and reduce your cash assets) or you pay on credit (and increase your debt).

#### Fixed expenses

These expenses do not change from month to month and, as such, are very easy to budget for. An example would be rent or mortgage repayments. While there can be changes in the payment over time, this is typically due to broader economic factors outside of our control as individuals (i.e. interest rates). Still, you can estimate the impact of such changes and adjust your budget to compensate for the increased cost.

A feature of a fixed cost for a business is the it remains the same even as output is increased. Linking this to our concept before of an expense representing how much of an asset is used up, let’s go back to our rent. If you rent a house for one month, you gain that benefit for one month. But if you work full time, much of your time will be spent outside your home. If you decide to stay home instead of working, your expense doesn’t increase. Hence the cost is fixed.

#### Flexible expenses

These expenses can vary from month to month but typically have a recurrent nature. A good example of flexible expenses would be a phone bill. You have a phone plan where you pay $20 a month however if you make a certain number of calls then you are charged an additional fee.

This type of expense can be difficult to budget for given that you may not be able to anticipate if you will incur additional charges or how much those charges may be (phone bills are notorious for this given the complexity of contracts).

Another example could be fuel for your car. Because the price of fuel is constantly fluctuating you may not know exactly how much you will spend on fuel in a month although you may know that you will fill your tank 2 times.

#### Discretionary expenses

These expenses are not usually incurred with regularity but are instead the kind of one off lifestyle expenses that you will incur. An example of this would be new clothes since you don’t buy a new wardrobe every month and you may decide to buy clothes when they are on special or when a new fashion trend comes in, rather than on a set schedule.

Discretionary may not be the best word for this category as it does imply that you could do without the expense which isn’t necessarily the case. Instead I’m using discretionary to imply that you decide when the expense is incurred &#8211; unlike your bills or mortgage which is paid on a recurrent schedule each month.

Unfortunately this type of expenditure is very tough to budget for properly since the amounts can vary widely and the timing is unknown. There are strategies for dealing with this type of expense but I will discuss that in another post.

#### Cash Flow

Your cash flow is the difference between all your income sources and your expenses. When you establish your budget you calculate your budgeted cash flow and once you have finished a month you end up with your actual cash flow. Both are helpful and analysing the difference between the two allows you to identify overspending in your budget and any areas where you may need to be more frugal.

In order to build wealth, you must have positive cash flow. Whether you are repaying debt (reducing liabilities) or saving/investing (increasing assets) you need to have a sufficient cash flow surplus. A deficit cash flow will result in increasing debt or decreasing assets &#8211; both of which will decrease your net wealth.
