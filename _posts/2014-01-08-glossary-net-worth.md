In the first of a series of glossary posts, I’m going to explain key terms used in finance.  I’m going to try and be as detailed as possible with my explanations and, as you will see, try and use diagrams to illustrate relationships between terms.

### Assets

Assets are future economic benefits; the things that you **own**.  There are many different ways to classify assets but from a personal finance perspective, assets can be understood to fall into the three categories discussed below.

When thinking about economic benefits, you have to consider more than just monetary benefits. Of course, money is a clear economic benefit but time is also an economic benefit. Take for example a dishwasher. You could spend one hour per day washing the dishes by hand or instead use the dishwasher saving you 45 minutes of your time (15 minutes would be spent stacking the dishwasher). Or think for a moment about a company that holds a patent. That patent provides economic benefits in the form of legal restrictions on other firms using their intellectual property. Economic benefits sounds like a simple concept, but can be quite complex when you unpack it.

The idea of economic benefits links directly with another economics concept called opportunity cost. Economics is the study of trade-offs; notably, which trade-off provides the greatest reward and the most efficient use of limited resources. If you think back to the dishwasher, you trade 45 minutes of time for the cost of running the dishwasher. Opportunity cost is the term economists use to describe the various options in the trade-off. In some cases there can be a very large number of options with the highest value option chosen.  When you receive an economic benefit, there is an accompanying opportunity cost and while both of these can be represented in non-monetary terms, for our purposes here we measure assets in dollar terms.

#### Depreciating Assets

A depreciating asset is one that loses value over time. They provide economic benefits to you at the cost of a reduction in the asset value, in other words, you use them up. Cars are the perfect example of depreciating assets. You purchase your new car, drive it causing wear and tear and eventually you have to resell it (for less than you paid initially) or you scrap it completely. Another, not so obvious example, is clothing. It follows the exact same lifecycle as your car but is of lesser value and so is often overlooked.

#### Appreciating Assets

An appreciating asset is one that gains value over time. They provide economic benefits to you but despite your usage of the asset, they increase in value. Land is the perfect example of an appreciating asset – increasing in value over time as the scarcity of and demand for land increases. An important distinction to mention here is that houses are not appreciating assets but instead depreciating assets.

The house you live in requires constant maintenance to ensure it remains in a good condition suitable for living in. If you didn’t pay for maintenance then the house would age and wear (much like your car or clothing) and eventually would require replacement. The reason why ‘house’ prices increase over time is because the *land* appreciates in value more than enough to compensate the depreciation of the house.

#### Income Producing Assets

An income producing asset is one that provides income payments to you over time. They will also fall into the category of either appreciating or depreciating assets but it’s important to distinguish income producing assets because of their special quality of generating income. Because of this, income producing assets are considered *investment assets.*

An example of an income producing asset is a share (or stock) in a publicly listed company that pays a dividend. As a shareholder, you are entitled to part of the company profits. If you receive money from a depreciating asset, it is a redemption of capital (i.e. you sell your car and receive cash) but with an income producing asset your receipt of money does not impact on the underlying value of the asset. The price of your share depends on the stock market and when you receive the dividend you are not selling any of the shares that you own.

Another example of an income producing asset is an investment property with the rental income you receive being consideration for the use of your property but the payment does not impact on the underlying value of the property.

### Liabilities

In contrast to assets, liabilities are future economic obligations; things that you **owe**.  I have decided to separate liabilities into two categories to highlight the distinction between different debts.

#### Lifestyle

Lifestyle liabilities are those debts incurred that relate to lifestyle expenses or depreciating assets.  Because the debt is linked to a depreciating asset there is never the possibility that the proceeds of sale of the asset will cover the debt, thereby leaving the borrower ultimately liable for repayment by other means.  This type of liability encompasses car loans, personal loans, credit cards and any unsecured debt.

#### Investment

Investment liabilities, in contrast, are debts incurred to purchase appreciating assets or income producing assets.  This class of debt is generally secured against the asset so should the borrower default, the asset is sold to recover the amount outstanding.  This debt is generally regarded as “good debt” since it allows an investor to use financial leverage and increase their returns for accepting a higher level of risk.

Examples of investment liabilities would be mortgages (to purchase either your principal residence or an investment property) or margin loans (for share investments).

It is important to highlight here what is called the “matching principle”.  This is the idea that the debt used to finance an asset purchase is the appropriate debt to use in that the terms and duration of the debt align with the features of the asset.  For example, you wouldn’t consider using a credit card to purchase an investment property since credit cards are designed for low value, short term transactions and incur a high interest rate while investment properties are high value, long term investments with comparatively low rental yields (the income earned from rent would be insufficient to cover the high repayments if calculated at credit card interest rates).

A common pitfall people make with their personal finances, is they use their mortgage to finance the purchase of furniture and white goods or sometimes even the family car.  While the interest rate available on the mortgage might be lower, because the term of the loan is much lower, it will likely eventuate that you will still be repaying your depreciating assets long after they are disposed of.

### Net Worth

Accounting has a golden rule.

> Assets &#8211; Liabilities = Net Worth

That’s it.  The entirety of accounting is based on that simple equation.  Net worth is often referred to as Owner’s Equity, Equity or Proprietorship as generally accountants work for companies and so use business based terminology.

The best way to understand Net Worth is the “left over” portion.  If you sold all your assets and repaid all your debts, how much would you have left over?  And as the name suggests, this figure represents your personal financial worth.

There are a few more of these glossary style posts planned, but please feel free to leave a comment with any terms you would like explained and I can cover them for you.
