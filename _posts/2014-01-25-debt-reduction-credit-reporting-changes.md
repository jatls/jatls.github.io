First off, the ASIC MoneySmart website has some good information regarding credit reporting that you can access <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/borrowing-and-credit/borrowing-basics/credit-reports-credit-repair" target="_blank">here</a>. You can also have a look at a sample credit report <a href="http://www.mycreditfile.com.au/dotAsset/508887.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. If you have never seen a credit report before I strongly suggest you check it out. And if you haven’t requested a copy of your own credit report before, you should follow the steps outlined on the MoneySmart page. By law you have to be able to access your own credit file for free although they do delay the report (generally 2 weeks) to encourage you to pay for prompt service.

### Upcoming changes

As of March 2014, the credit report will show a greater level of detail about you. Your existing loan providers will report additional information about you to reporting agencies which can then, in turn, be viewed when a credit check is conducted. Briefly, the new information includes:

  * account status and credit limit
  * type of credit
  * repayment history information
  * additional details of the credit provider

So now, more than ever, ensuring that your bills are paid on time is vital to maintaining a good standing with the credit agencies. These changes will make it easier for lenders to accurately predict your repayment behaviour and make their decision based on that prediction.

### What is a credit report?

If you read through the links above, you will see that a credit report or credit file is simply a listing of your current loans, applications you have made for credit and any overdue issues you have had.

Your credit report is your money story. If you have applied for multiple credit cards with multiple companies in one month, that tells a story. If you repay all your bills on time and have never had an overdue notice, that tells a different story. The key to credit reporting is to make sure that the story your report tells is accurate.

Most of the credit reporting websites will help you to remove fraudulent or erroneous information on your credit report (with a surname like Smith, I know it happens). And other sites will offer you help to fix your credit report for a small fortune. The best way to get a good credit report is to manage your finances well, understand credit reporting and realise that time is your friend.

Please note, you may have various credit ratings with the three different agencies however your credit report is universal. The same events are reported to all agencies but the way that they grade individuals and risk differ.

### Understanding your credit report

When you get a copy of your credit report, have a look first for anything that is not quite right &#8211; identity theft is real and can affect you directly through your credit report. Next focus on the black marks &#8211; credit defaults. If you have been late making payment or overdue with a bill, you may have a black mark on your record. This is normally easily fixed by sorting out the issue directly with the credit provider. Payment of your debt in full works wonders and your credit report will reflect the fact that the debt has been repaid and the issue now resolved with the provider.

Then look at your current accounts or your outstanding debts. Make sure that what is reported on your credit file is accurate and if you have recently cancelled a credit card or paid off a loan, check that it is removed from your file. This is important because a lingering debt on your credit file will impact your credit worthiness.

Finally review your applications for credit. Keep in mind that lots of businesses will conduct credit checks but they must obtain your permission first. That said, some hide the credit declaration in other paperwork so you might not be fully aware. Because we so frequently access credit these days (even if we don’t realise it) there can be a lot of applications on your credit record. This is not necessarily a bad thing if the story it tells about you is a good one.

For example, there would be no problems if you had applications for credit from your bank, phone provider, rental agency, car dealership and utility company. This paints a picture of a fairly average Australian and as long as there are no defaults or outstanding debts, credit approval should be straightforward.

Also keep in mind that the type of debt you are applying for will have different requirements and restrictions. So if you are applying for an unsecured loan for a holiday the lending criteria will be more strict than if you are applying for a secured car loan. Firstly, the bank can’t repossess your holiday but they can repossess your car. Secondly, depending on the risk to the bank, they can adjust the terms of the loan to compensate. This is why your unsecured loan will have a higher interest rate (typically) than secured loans.

### What if you have a bad history?

First and foremost (as mentioned before) if you are having trouble with debt, sort it out with the credit provider. It’s important that you resolve any issues as quickly as possible and in a way that is acceptable to the credit provider.

If you do happen to get a default on your credit report, this will stay there for five years. If it get’s very serious then you can have various notices on your report for up to ten years. Nothing stays longer than ten years so time works in your favour if you have had a terrible credit history and are looking to fix it up. In most cases, if you can demonstrate that you had problems in the past but now have your finances under control then you will be more acceptable for credit approval.

If you do have a bad record, be up front about it to any company that would want to know that information. You can’t hide it when they run the report so may as well be honest about it as that also helps build a picture of you as a borrower. Furthermore, make sure you provide a written explanation of any default or outstanding amount that is showing on your credit report when applying for further credit. Remember, typically the person arranging the loan for you is making a commission off your loan so they have a vested interest in helping you secure the loan. If it doesn’t go ahead then they wont get their bonus. Use that to your advantage.

Finally, as I mentioned earlier, before a credit check is done, you need to provide permission for the company to do that check. If you have a bad history, be careful and selective about when you apply for finance. I have heard of some people who simply apply for finance just to “see what they can get” or they have dozens of credit cards “just in case”. This is not necessary and can count against you when applying for additional (perhaps more important) credit. It also never hurts to ask whether a credit check will be done **before** you sign a contract or authority. Keep those applications for additional credit to a minimum and always keep in the back of your mind the picture that you want your credit file to paint about you.
