Today marks the end of one month of blogging.  Not bad.  One post a day for the entire month. Actually I think I missed a day &#8230; but shhhh!

So far, (not including links to other sites) I&#8217;ve written 16,352 words, had 71 visits by 27 unique visitors. Not too bad for something I decided to do on a whim.

Not sure if I will keep up the same frequency of posts, but we&#8217;ll see how it goes.

Now is a perfect time to subscribe though. Although I cross post on facebook, the more people who look at my stuff, the more it gets hidden away (in an attempt to drive up their ad revenue). So if you want to keep up to date, subscribe on tumblr, by [rss][1] or just come back regularly. Please also tell your friends and pass on any useful posts. Exposure is nice.

I hope you have all managed to get something out of what I have written so far and I hope to keep writing and helping people understand more about money in to the future. This is also a great time to encourage people to contact me with questions they might have about money or finance. If you want to know something or just have a cool idea, [let me know][2].
