> We have a family member who is in a fair bit of debt and completely sucks with budgeting. What are your thoughts on services like mybudget? We’re happy to hand it over to someone else to sort out but are there any hidden disadvantages (like affecting their credit rating more than their debt, and of course that they don’t learn through the process how to budget)?

To be perfectly honest, I’m in two minds about services like this and perhaps leaning towards the negative side for this particular service.

Generally speaking, I think it’s important for people to take control of their own finances and develop their own understanding. Services like this that take that away from individuals I don’t think add anything valuable to their clients lives long term. Basically, if you find their service effective, you are perpetually reliant on that service in order to appropriately manage your money.

I’ve used this analogy before (and will continue to use it &#8211; because it works so well); budgeting is like losing weight. There are a number of different methods to go about it but ultimately you have to make some tough decisions, put in some hard work and stick to it. I think it’s important for people to realise up front that managing money can be challenging at time and it can be hard to find motivation but it is, of itself, not difficult. Same as going to the gym and eating a healthy diet.

Now imagine for a minute a service called mygym. For a low monthly payment, you can have a trained professional visit the gym and work out on your behalf. Sounds silly right? But isn’t this essentially what we’re talking about doing with money? Oh, but don’t worry, your fitness assistant will still keep your training goals in mind &#8211; lose *x* kilos, build muscle, boost general fitness.

I understand the desire to outsource budgeting &#8211; particularly when in debt and trouble financially. But a key aspect of budgeting is controlling your spending through discipline. Can you learn that discipline by handing over to someone else? I doubt it.

I do appreciate though that many people struggle with debt, don’t know where to begin to fix the problems and need help. Financial planners don’t generally spend time working with these people and with fee for service becoming standard practice, the up front cost of visiting a planner can be prohibitive. This is where financial counsellors step in. They specifically deal with debt management, budgeting and simple personal finance matters. They have a focus on education and empowerment and typically charge no fees (as they are supported by a charity or based on volunteer labour). I personally think financial counsellors offer a better value service for the community as a whole.

Specifically on mybudget.com.au, I have heard some horror stories particularly around exorbitant fees. Looking at their website they don’t disclose their fees which always makes me cautious. I realise that they tailor their services to their clients and charge based on the services provided but at least give a range or average or similar on the website so people can see what they will be paying.

On fees, this type of service is unregulated by the current financial services legislation since they are not providing financial product advice. This means that they don’t have to follow the same rules as financial planners when disclosing fees and this leaves room for rorting. I’m not saying at all that this is what mybudget does but simply pointing out that the possibility for unscrupulous operators to exploit the financially vulnerable in our community and make *millions* in the process.***

My suggestion to your family member would be to find a local financial counsellor and speak to them first. At no cost, there’s nothing to lose and everything to gain.
