I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about financial literacy lately and specifically how I know what I know. Sure, I studied at university which taught me a lot of detail around accounting, finance, money and business but I realised there&#8217;s another vital element to this story. And let&#8217;s not forget that the focus of accounting or finance courses is to teach you about business, not personal matters. Of course the fundamental principles still apply, so simply studying Accounting 101 will not make you financially literate in your personal life but it will give you the tools you need as a starting point.

As you may have realised by now (and I&#8217;m pretty sure I have said it before), I&#8217;m obsessed by money. Don&#8217;t confuse this for being obsessed with **having** money. Instead I&#8217;m obsessed with how money works, understanding it and then passing that on to others. Obsession is vital.

I realised that it was my constant musings about money that have helped me to build a strong understanding of it. This might sound crazy but it&#8217;s important to realise that money is just a collection of ideas. It&#8217;s not a physical aspect of our reality. I have a physicist friend who finds this very bizarre since, in his field, he deals with the fundamental laws of nature not rules created by men.

So simply by thinking about money more and more, you can expand your financial literacy. It&#8217;s important that your thinking is guided by questions and that you do further research when necessary (even if it is just wikipedia). One of these key questions which guides my thoughts about money is &#8220;how do you make money?&#8221; It&#8217;s a really important question for both understanding our interactions with others financially and growing our understanding of money.

Some examples are really simple. How does a green grocer make money? She trades fruits an vegetables &#8211; buying them at a cheaper price than he sells them to you. Or perhaps she grows some of the produce herself and can increase her profit margin.

Some examples are more complex. How does facebook make money? Most of us know these days that they profit from advertising revenue targeted at their users based on their personal information they upload on to the site. The emergence of data as a commodity is a very interesting topic that we should talk about another time.

Some examples have multiple answers. A company like Apple generates revenue from both the sale of iPhones and the sale of apps for the phone. This lets you ask more questions, like &#8220;which generates more revenue?&#8221; and helps you get a deeper understanding for the business. It also informs the way you deal with the company. So, if you know that Apple makes more money from app sales than it does from phone sales (which it does) then you will start to understand the significance of the $0.99 app.

These questions are really quite simple and the answers aren&#8217;t too much more complicated. But the process of asking the question, thinking about the problem, coming up with an answer and researching to confirm your conclusion will get you to think about money in ways you haven&#8217;t thought about before. And if you like, you can start right now!
