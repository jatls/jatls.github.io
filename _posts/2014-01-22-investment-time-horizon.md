We previously discussed the importance of investor profiling and investing in line with your risk tolerance in mind. Another key consideration is your investment time horizon or how long you will be investing for.

When you consider a risky investment, the risk can be quantified mathematically as the uncertainty of your future returns. So you might be looking to buy shares in a firm and calculate that in the best case scenario you will earn 18% (combined capital growth and dividend income) in one year but worst case scenario is that you will earn -4% in the same year. The true return for the stock will fall somewhere in between these two values but you won’t know that until one year has passed. And by then it’s too late to invest.

So you have to decide from this whether or not you will make the investment. Everyone’s answer will differ since, as we discussed before, everyone has a different tolerance level for risky situations. But now we will introduce the time horizon.

Let’s say for our stock, we calculate that one in every 7 years our stock will achieve a negative return and lose us money. How does this affect your decision to invest? Well, like your risk tolerance, your answer will vary. If you are approaching retirement in the next 2 years, the risk that one of those years will net you a loss might be too great a risk. On the other hand, if you have 40 years until retirement, it probably doesn’t matter as much if you suffer a loss now, since you have the benefit of time to recoup any losses.

As a side note, since we know that risk is a representation of uncertainty in returns, a more conservative investment (less risk) will lead to more certain returns. The most certain return being a deposit in a bank account that earns a fixed interest rate. The rate might be low but it is guaranteed. Whereas the rate of return you can achieve in the stock market might be greater but there is uncertainty associated with it and so we refer to it as higher risk.

And that’s the principle in a nutshell.
