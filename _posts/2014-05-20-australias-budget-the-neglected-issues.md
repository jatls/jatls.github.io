In a facebook discussion recently I mentioned the gaping holes in the recent federal budget which, for some reason, the media seem to have overlooked or ignored. Instead they choose to focus on certain issues which, it seems, are widely misunderstood by the public and simply serve to increase dissatisfaction with the current government without any reasonable basis. This was highlighted in a [recent QandA episode][1] where the treasurer easily rebutted many points from the audience by simply explaining the policy announcement instead of being pressured on key points which the government haven&#8217;t addressed and for which, I believe, they have no answer.

When asked what these holes were, I replied with the response below.

[blockquote]Well, for starters, no one has really discussed the mechanism by which doctors visits will be tracked for concession card holders reaching 10 visits per year. The assumption is that people will always seek care from the same GP, but this falls over when you consider that many people go to the doctor or clinic that can fit them in when they are ill. And the medicare system isn&#8217;t set up to track this kind of thing. As far as I can tell, the cost of implementing the infrastructure around this monitoring hasn&#8217;t been considered.

While cutting social security benefits for young people in half (with the 6 months on and 6 months off regime), they are at the same time introducing incentives for older Australians to re-engage with the work force by means of a lump sum payment to employers. How does this help with youth employment engagement given most employers value experience over school based training and the government&#8217;s own modelling showing youth unemployment is at a higher rate than all other demographic sectors? Surely a bonus for employers to hire young Australians and provide them with on-the-job training and experience is just as important for long term economic sustainability and productivity growth. Instead, we have highly qualified young people stuck in low paid jobs carrying a large chunk of government debt (HELP loans) which aren&#8217;t being repaid due to their unemployment, under-employment or lack of qualified employment.

There is also an underlying assumption that the reason youth unemployment is high is because they lack training and qualifications (particularly from university). But in my experience, the opposite is true. Uni&#8217;s churn out graduates in every possible field imaginable thereby creating an oversupply of graduates, driving down wages (impacting on HELP repayment) and increasing competition for jobs (leading to youth unemployment).

There is also a lot of irony in the government cutting the company tax rate by 1.5% whilst at the same time increasing personal tax rates for those on the highest marginal rate. Let&#8217;s not forget that those earning the highest incomes, have the greatest access to resources to minimise their tax bills while companies often play conservatively when it comes to taxation (whilst still receiving quite significant tax benefits). Being the &#8220;business party&#8221; isn&#8217;t justification enough for cutting tax rates in the middle of a &#8220;budget emergency&#8221;.

If you remember the policy announcement, the company tax rate cut was to reduce the impact of the (highly contentious) paid parental leave scheme which barely gets a mention in the budget. Certainly not the flagship policy that was announced at the election. But despite all that, it wasn&#8217;t companies complaining (at the time) about the PPLS but instead what seemed like a majority of the &#8220;average folk&#8221; &#8211; parents and families who would no doubt see the benefit of such a scheme. So now, we&#8217;ll give the tax cut to business but hold off on the introduction of the PPLS. Smells like cooking the books to me.

And what about the NBN? All quiet on this front. No reform, no scrapping of Labor&#8217;s plan. Just business as usual up to an, albeit lower than Labor had costed, cap. Why, in a budget riddled with broken promises, would the government not highlight a broken promise that would actually resonate positively with the electorate. Sure, we might have no income for 6 months of the year, but at least we can stream Game of Thrones to pass the time.

Is that enough?[/blockquote]
