If you have a mortgage you may already be familiar with Home Loan Offset Accounts.  Essentially this type of account treats the account balance as having already been paid off your mortgage when interest is calculated each month.  This means that you can significantly reduce the interest paid over the term of your mortgage and therefore reduce the time it takes to repay the debt.

Below are some graphs illustrating this point.

1% of the loan balance held in the offset account &#8211; reduces the loan term by 1 year.

10% of the loan balance held in the offset account &#8211; reduces the loan term by 7 years.

One key thing that this type of account can teach us is that interest saved is the same as interest earned.  Consider we have a mortgage currently charging 5% per annum in interest and we also have access to a savings account paying 3% per annum.  If we invested in the savings account we would earn less than we would save by paying down our debt at 5%. If we could attain a higher investment return then we would be better investing the funds instead of reducing our debt.

The other neat feature of the home loan offset account is that your funds stay available in the account as per normal. In other words you get the benefits of having paid down your debt early (reduced interest) without losing access to your money.  All the major banks offer these types of account so if you don’t already have one, check with your lender to see if it’s right for you.
