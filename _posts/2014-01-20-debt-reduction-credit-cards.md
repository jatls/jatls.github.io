Credit cards can be useful financial tools but if not managed carefully things can get out of control very quickly. There’s no right answer when it comes to handling credit card debt, but I will outline one strategy that could help.

### Step one &#8211; destroy the card

This might sound obvious or cliche but it’s the best way to force you not to use your card. I could say stop using it but sometimes that’s just not an option if we are heavily reliant on our cards. You can always get a new card once your finances are under control.

You may also be able to negotiate with your bank to consolidate your debt or do a balance transfer to a more attractive offer. Just remember that if you do move to a new card (with a lower interest rate) you still have to cut it up. You can’t use it until your existing debt is repaid.

### Step two &#8211; set a strict budget

This is vital. Make a budget and include everything that is essential to your survival. And follow your budget to the letter.

There are two things to mention here. Firstly is to allow yourself a discretionary spending budget. If you have the ability to splurge but can restrict it from affecting other areas then your budget will be more effective. Secondly is to do your best to live frugally. Make those hard choices and focus on a debt free future when you will have more flexibility. Work now and benefit later.

### Step three &#8211; allocate your budget surplus to your debt

Focus on your debt that carries the highest interest rate and pay as much as possible in one go. The idea is to drive your debt down as quickly as possible so you reduce interest. Once you have hit one card, move on to the next debt and so on until there is none left.

### Step four &#8211; spend responsibly

The trick is to only spend money you have. If it’s not in your budget (and not allocated to that spending cayegory) then you have to make do. If you follow this rule then you should never have a credit card debt carry over to the next month.

### Optional step &#8211; debt consolidation

This involves taking out a loan to repay multiple existing outstanding debts. It might seem counter intuitive to take out another loan if you are struggling to meet your existing commitments but by doing this would cancel your existing credit cards, have them repaid in full and then you would have one payment each fortnight/month (best to select an option which matches the frequency of your pay cheque) that you can focus on paying down. Also, you can generally negotiate an interest rate better than those available on credit cards.

With debt consolidation, you still need to follow the above rules and you should still work to repay as much of the debt as possible each month. This strategy can save you money in the long run, but you still have to look at your available options and your specific circumstances. If in doubt, you should seek help from a professional financial counsellor or financial adviser. They will be able to tailor a debt reduction plan to your needs, and most financial counsellors will provide you advice at no cost.
