Properly answering your question is difficult because everyone’s circumstances are different and unfortunately there’s no standard response. But instead of just giving you the old “it depends” response, we will look at what exactly a first home saver account is, the advantages, disadvantages and alternatives. Hopefully that will help you better assess your individual circumstances and decide on the best course of action.

The most important point I can make right from the start though is that **any** savings is better than none at all. If putting money away in a first home saver account is what you need to do to encourage your saving habit, then stick with it.

### What is a first home saver account?

For those who don’t already know, a [first home saver account][1] is a special type of savings account provided to help individuals save for their first home (as the name suggests). The account is government sponsored, so provided you actually save, the federal government will support you with a contribution. It’s similar in operation to superannuation co-contributions but the amounts are different. The government will contribute 17% of whatever you save in a financial year to help you out – up to a maximum of $1,020.

Any interest you earn is taxed at 15% and you have to save at least $1,000 a year for four years before you can make a withdrawal. Once you are eligible to withdraw the funds, they must be used to buy your first house or to pay off the mortgage of your existing house (say if you bought after holding the account for only two years).

If you don’t use the first home saver account you also have the option to transfer the balance to your superannuation so you don’t lose the co-contribution but of course then the funds are held in superannuation until you meet a condition of release.

### Advantages

  * <span>Your savings are boosted by government co-contributions.</span>
  * <span>Like superannuation, your funds are taxed at a concessional rate (potentially lower than your marginal tax rate.</span>
  * <span>You can combine two first home saver accounts if you purchase the home in joint names – allowing greater savings and double the co-contributions.</span>
  * <span>Typically low or no fees.</span>

### Disadvantages

  * <span>Your savings are ‘locked in’ for at least four years and you must save at least $1,000 in a year to be eligible for co-contributions.</span>
  * <span>If you don’t use the savings for a home then they are ‘trapped’ in superannuation.</span>
  * <span>Accessing the funds can be a bit bureaucratic and penalties apply if you ‘misuse’ the funds.</span>
  * <span>The interest rate typically is lower than could be returned from other investments, although is competitive compared to other cash accounts.</span>
  * <span>The account must be held in one name only making lower value joint savings difficult, particularly in the event of relationship breakdown.</span>

### What are some alternatives?

Of course you could open any high interest savings account. Most banks and credit unions these days offer low fee or no fee accounts with high interest rates. Of course you wouldn’t receive the co-contribution and that needs to be considered. If your goal is to save for a new home and you can get 2.5% per annum from a first home saver account plus the co-contribution, then any alternative investment would need to beat that return. Assuming you saved $6,000 in the year, you would earn $1,020 in co-contributions and approximately $150 in interest. This would give you an effective interest rate of 17.95%. If you save more in the year, your interest would increase but the co-contribution would remain the same, thereby reducing the effective interest rate.

It is possible that a direct share investment (or managed fund investment) could exceed those returns though and without the same restrictions on usage for the funds. However, there is added risk in purchasing shares and fundamentally a first home saver account is a cash holding (risk free asset).

Ultimately whether or not this type of account is suitable for you is your decision, but there are very few times when the government will give you free money. If this type of account aligns with your goals then it could be perfect for you. From my experience though they haven’t been all that common which could simply be due to people not understanding them fully or the disadvantages outweighing the advantages for them. Whatever the reason, people should certainly be considering these accounts when they plan their first home purchase.

Since you already have money in the account (and assuming you are still intending to purchase a home with those savings), keeping the account and savings directed toward it will allow you to continue to benefit from the co-contribution. By directing the funds elsewhere you will need to be adequately compensated for the additional risk. And if you have already purchased your home, contribute any additional mortgage payments towards the first home saver account to benefit from the co-contribution then after four years (or longer if that suits your purposes), withdraw the balance to repay the mortgage (this is allowed). I’m fairly sure that you wouldn’t be paying 17-odd percent on your mortgage repayments. But keep in mind that your account balance in the first home saver is [limited to $90,000][2] which does put an upper limit on this strategy.

I hope this clears things up for you a bit. If you have any other questions, please leave a comment or ask using the link above.
