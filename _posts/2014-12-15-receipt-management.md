I read <a href="http://moneyning.com/shopping-smart/how-long-should-you-keep-receipts/" target="_blank">this article</a> today which is all about how long to keep receipts. They make a fairly convincing argument that the potential benefit of retaining receipts longer term (5-7 years) outweighs the cost in storing the receipts. It also suggests a system for storing receipts which is a really good idea. But I feel that the proposed solution is stuck in the 20th century. So, here&#8217;s my system which is a little more 21st century.

Every receipt, bill or similar, is scanned in and filed away based on the date it is scanned (with sub folders to narrow down the structure and keep things organised. It is important that each receipt can be quickly recovered when required. Since all transactions are entered in to <a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/" target="_blank">YNAB</a>, there is a searchable index of all receipts automatically generated so in the event a receipt is required, the transaction is identified, the date is revealed and a quick browse to the virtual filing cabinet reveals the receipt.

The scanned receipts are typically quite compact in size and can be compressed/archived for long term storage. They can also be backed up to the cloud or remotely in case of hardware failure. And the originals can be destroyed (yes, my inner accountant cries a little bit every time the shredder fires up, but this is a practical reality of the modern reality).

The only potential argument against this system would be that some retailers may be a little hesitant to accept a digital copy of a receipt as valid proof of purchase. Whilst I can understand that argument perhaps for a smaller retailer, the larger retailers have the ability to uniquely identify transactions. Credit card transaction details can be used to cross reference and, ultimately, the bearer of the receipt is always assumed to have made the purchase regardless of reality. There may be some arguing required but given that government departments are happy to have electronic scanned copies of invoices and other documentation provided and retained for audit purposes, it should be no different for individuals. <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/07/ask-lh-are-scanned-receipts-valid-when-i-ask-for-a-refund/" target="_blank">This covers it off a little more thoroughly than my ramblings.</a>

And a hidden benefit of this scheme is apparent around Christmas time. How many times have you given or received a gift only to require exchange. Then you have to dig up the receipt and find a way to get it back to the recipient. The last time this happened to me, the receipts had to be posted to me &#8211; how archaic! This Christmas, any double ups or returns can be managed with a quick email. I can find the receipt in the cloud and immediately forward it to the recipient. They can then take this on their phone to the store of origin and that&#8217;s it. Simple and efficient.

And to the question of time frame &#8211; given the size of the scans and the cost of storage space these days, there&#8217;s no reason not to keep your receipts forever.

Do you keep your receipts? And what&#8217;s your system? I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts in the comments.
