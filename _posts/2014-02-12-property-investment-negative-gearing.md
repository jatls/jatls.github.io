I’m sure everyone is familiar with the term *negative gearing* but I would also suggest that no as many would actually know what it is or means. Hopefully this will clarify.

In finance, *gearing* simply means to use borrowed money, typically for investment purposes. You might sometimes hear analysts speak of a company being “heavily geared” meaning that they have a lot of debt compared to shareholder equity. Negative gearing specifically applies to individual property investment and the tax rules associated with it. Where an individual owns an investment property that makes a loss, they are entitled to offset their investment losses against their other taxable (employment) income. Since, under these rules, a property investor will effectively use tax payer funds for their own investment purposes.

An example will help illustrate. You are a doctor earning $250,000 per year which would result in a tax bill of roughly $90,000. By investing in property, you incur losses of $10,000 which reduce your assessable income to $240,000 per year &#8211; saving you approximately $5,000 in tax. Not bad!

Needless to say, this is a popular strategy amongst those with high taxable income searching for deductions although in the property investment landscape in Australia, negative gearing receives a lot less press these days than it has in the past.

But, I hear you asking, if I have to spend $1 in owning an investment property in order to obtain a $0.50 tax deduction, it’s not really worth while! And that is a common objection to negative gearing strategies. However, accountants will argue that this strategy **is** effective since a large portion of your investment property losses will be in depreciation expenses which are just expenses on paper. It is possible for your cash flow to be positive each week but from the tax man’s perspective, you are actually making a loss.

The other relevant point is that property (typically) is an appreciating asset so even though you are paying for a tax deduction in the short term, long term the property appreciation should offset this and increase your overall net wealth. That said, to structure this type of investment well is difficult because of the intricacy in the rules, the assumptions you must make at the outset (when assessing viability) and the risk that tax laws may change in the future thereby making your investment ineffective and/or causing a decline in housing prices.

Some people also question why the government allows such a vast range of deductions for investment properties and there are fairly regular calls for negative gearing to be abolished. The reason negative gearing exists is to incentivise the actions of private individuals and, in doing so, increase both the availability of rental accommodation (for those who need it) and decrease rents through increased competition. Whether these aims are effectively achieved through negative gearing or whether negative gearing is the best mechanism government can use to achieve these aims is another debate for another day. But the fact remains that negative gearing is a part of our tax and investing landscape and reminds us all that when assessing the viability of an investment, any available tax concessions or incentives should at the very least be investigated.

My own personal view is, if an investment is only viable due to tax concessions or tax strategies, then it is not a viable investment. Everyone’s opinion will differ in this regard and perhaps my view is too conservative here. But whatever your view is, it is still vital to know whether or not the success of your investment is dependant on external subsidies so you can make the best investment decision.
