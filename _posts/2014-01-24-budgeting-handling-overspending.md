One unavoidable fact of budgeting is overspending. No matter how frugal and disciplined you are, you will overspend on your budget. It makes sense since real life hardly ever goes *exactly* to plan. Like any plan, it’s not about making sure that reality aligns to your plan but instead about how you adapt your plan to a constantly changing reality. So let’s talk about managing overspending.

### The most common method

This method, although most common, is also the worst. This method is to give up your budgeting efforts because you have ‘failed’ at your budget. You will see similar responses to diet and exercise &#8211; instead of just admitting your fault or mistake and moving forward with the plan, the proverbial towel is thrown and everything grinds to a halt. Needless to say, this is not the recommended method.

### The carried debt

This method lets you have a negative balance in any category which is carried across to future months (budgeting period) until the debt is repaid. This doesn’t stop any additional spending and in order to be successful you need to have access to capital (savings) or debt you can draw on in order to continue to meet your ongoing expenses.

It works by starting the new month with your old budget. Each category will have a balance from the previous month, either positive (good), zero (okay) or negative (less good) which is carried forward to the next month. Then, when income is allocated to the next month, income paid to that category increases that category and (hopefully) covers any outstanding deficit.

This method is useful as a stop gap and when you are trying to control debt. It’s not ideal and once you have your finances under control then I suggest moving on to the next method since it is more robust. Still, this method has its purpose. Using this method however it is possible to carry a category deficit month after month without any remedy being implemented.

### The rollover

This method is the most rare and, in my opinion, the ideal. This involves taking your total overspending for the current month and deducting it from your pool of income to allocate in next month’s budget. This forces you to repay yourself for any overspending from your future budget.

Perhaps another way to think about it is like this, you have budgets set up for groceries, electricity and rent (obviously simplified). You overspend in groceries but since you consistently hold a balance in your electricity and rent categories, you are able to buy your groceries without any trouble. Then at the start of next month, before you allocate any income to your budget, you must first repay the money that you borrowed from your other two categories. Only then can you allocate the leftovers for the next month.

To link it to the previous method, only surplus category balances are carried forward to the next month. Any negative category balances are reset to zero for the next month.

This method admits that it’s normal to overspend but you address it by acknowledging your mistake, remedying the situation (repaying your other categories) and planning to succeed next month (budgeting only the remainder &#8211; forcing you to be frugal). These are the same steps that you would have to follow if you faltered in your diet plan or exercise regime so it makes sense to implement them for your budget too.

Finally, this method works best when you are living off last month’s income. I know I haven’t discussed that yet and we will get to that since it is the single most liberating feature of budgeting that you can do. It takes some time and effort, but once you are there, it releases the pressure that frugality and budgeting can (sometimes) impose on us. So sit tight for more on that.
