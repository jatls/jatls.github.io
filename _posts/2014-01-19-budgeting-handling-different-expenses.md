In my earlier post [discussing the various classifications for income and expenses][1], I had eluded to a post outlining the different ways of budgeting for each of the expense classifications.  This is that.

### Fixed Expenses

Since these are the same cost recurring into the future, you can take the amount you pay (annual, quarterly, monthly, fortnightly) and simply transform that in to the same period you budget with.  For example, I budget monthly so for home insurance (annual) I divide by twelve.  I find monthly budgeting the easiest to line up with bills, but fortnightly works well if you are paid fortnightly.  Just depends on what makes most sense for you.

One thing to be mindful of, is inflation.  It is unlikely that your bills will stay fixed in perpetuity but instead will increase over time.  When I first started budgeting I had to make an educated guess at the level of inflation for each category but over time, I gathered more and more data on my expenses and could then project forwards to see where prices would be based on historical increases.  While this isn’t perfect, it certainly has turned out to be very accurate.

This is why it is important to continually review your budget.  Over time prices will change, but also your priorities and tastes will change.  And, if you’re a parent, you also have to think about the changing needs of your children.

### Flexible Expenses

These are harder to budget for but since they are based on usage, you can gain a fair idea for the anticipated cost from last month’s usage and by looking forward at the month ahead.  Flexible expenses make the case for a shorter budgeting term (say weekly) as it is easier to project your weekly usage but there is always a trade off since it can be harder to budget for your quarterly expenses if you use a weekly time frame.

The best way to budget for flexible expenses, I have found, is to have a strong buffer.  Always work to the worst case (reasonable) scenario when estimating so you have a bit of a buffer.  Also, if you over allocate this month, you review and revise next month and you might allocate less to a given flexible expense next month since you already have a good buffer in place.

The important thing here is that you want to be saving a little bit for each of these expenses to protect yourself in the case of a cost blow out.  This gives you an extra line of defence and should help to reduce the stresses of receiving a big bill.  I know in winter time, our gas bill jumps because of heating costs &#8211; but in the summer time we build up a strong buffer so I don’t have to worry about having the funds there to cover the bill.

### Discretionary Expenses

The way I see these types of expenses is as the leftovers.  So you start by receiving income, then you save a percentage, then from your reduced income you deduct your budgets for all your fixed costs, then all your allocations for your flexible costs.  Whatever is left after that can be allocated to your discretionary expenses.

The thing with discretionary expenses is that there is no right or wrong answer as to what is classified as discretionary.  Everyone will have a different classification based on their needs and priorities.  Some people may see their mobile phone as a discretionary, luxury item while others may see it as a vital part of their life.  Obviously the way you structure your expenses reflects your priorities and your budget should reflect them too.

The thing to remember about discretionary expenses is that you must remained disciplined and follow your allocation.  There’s no room for error as overspending on discretionary items will cause a budget deficit.  We will discuss how to handle those types of deficits soon, but the best way is to avoid it altogether.  And controlling your discretionary expenses is key.

Maybe another way you can think about it is that your discretionary expenses cover your “wants” while the other expense types cover your “needs”.  Obviously it is more important that your “needs” are met, in priority over your “wants”.  I realise this is easier said than done and even the frugality gurus struggle with this step.

I thought this might give a little more clarity around the different expense categories, give you an insight in to my budgeting practices and also help you with your own budgeting.
