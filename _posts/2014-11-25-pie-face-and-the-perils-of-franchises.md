I heard <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2014/s4135395.htm" target="_blank">this article on the radio today</a> talking about the Pie Face franchise going in to administration. For the most part, a pretty regular news story (although not a very good one for an Australian based franchise operation). But there were comments from one former franchisee which worried me a little.

&nbsp;

[blockquote source=&#8221;Aleks Trajceski&#8221;]When I compare my P&L (profit and loss) for a whole year of operating to the P&L that was given to us by Pie Face, the net operating profit down the bottom shows a difference of more than $100,000.

I was working 12 hours a day in the store trying to keep expenses down, keeping control of every little thing, of ordering, of staffing and everything that I could trying to keep as good a control as possible to keep our costs down and it couldn&#8217;t work.[/blockquote]

I&#8217;m not that concerned by his complaining that company projections didn&#8217;t match his actual results. I am more worried that he speaks about working long hours trying to &#8220;control every little thing&#8221;. Now I don&#8217;t know his exact circumstances but it seems to me like he was trying to drive profits only by increasing efficiency when he should have looked at his options to increase revenue. I am also a little worried whenever I hear a story of a business owner working long hours *in* their business and not *on* their business.

This is a key distinction made very well in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-E-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses/dp/0887307280" target="_blank">Michael Gerber&#8217;s E-Myth</a>. In order to control costs, it sounds as if this business owner started taking on more and more responsibilities of the business himself. And that is doomed to fail since the requirements of any business are generally more demanding than just one person can handle. Instead of doing the strategic work of the business, he got busy doing business and this lack of a big picture approach is, in my opinion, what lead to the ultimate failure of his business. And unfortunately it is all too common.

If you are running a small business, or have aspirations of running a business, I highly encourage you to read The E-Myth. It&#8217;s a great read and is vital in order to understand how businesses grow, develop and ultimately achieve success. It also helps to develop skills in understanding businesses and to think more critically about how the businesses you interact with on a daily basis operate. And how they turn operations in to profit.
