Just before I get started, I must say that this post already makes me feel dirty and I haven&#8217;t even started yet.

As you may have noticed already, there is a new section on the sidebar to your right. Yep. It&#8217;s a PayPal donation button. I&#8217;ve turned in to one of those guys.

First of all, I hate ads. Passionately! I will never put ads on this site as I think they single handedly ruin the Internet. I understand the necessity for them but I still hate them.

Secondly, I hate blogs and forums that continuously nag their subscribers to give them money. I&#8217;ve had many arguments with site admins in the past about this (basically telling them if they can&#8217;t afford to run the site and no one is interested then they should &#8220;kindly shut up shop and investigate alternative ventures&#8221; &#8211; spelt F\*** OFF!) <del>and yet ironically here I am</del>.

So I&#8217;ve added a donation button to this site to perhaps get some support if possible. Running a site like this costs me money personally and also the time I invest to write and maintain the content. And at the moment I&#8217;m a one man band! I&#8217;m not going to continually bug you for contributions but if you read the site and find it helpful; consider buying me a virtual coffee. I&#8217;m also not going to hold you to ransom since I like writing and I love that you are here reading it even more (look at me, I&#8217;m famous!).

I figured that some people who read this blog might get something useful out of it. If a tip I&#8217;ve shared can save you or make you more money then I am super happy. If you decide to share a small portion of that with me then I am even happier. I also have an alterier motive &#8211; I figure now I have a place to direct people to when I speak with them personally and they want to thank me with a small donation.

Hopefully this little button is not too obtrusive to your reading experience and I&#8217;m sorry to all my fans for selling out.
