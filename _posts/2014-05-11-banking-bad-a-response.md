Last Monday, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2014/05/05/3995954.htm" target="_blank">Four Corners on ABC aired a program</a> about the questionable practices of financial planners working with the big four banks in Australia. A few different cases were covered with the focus initially on a Commonwealth Bank customer who was sold an unsuitable life insurance policy and afterwards much of the investigation devoted to rouge financial planner Don Nguyen. The news about Don Nguyen is old, with him no longer operating as a financial planner but the journalist was using the examples of 5-6 years ago to link to the more recent example of the unsuitable life insurance policy.

Watching these stories, my heart sank both for the families devastated by the advice of their financial planner and for the industry generally. I know, first hand, that every day caring and ethical advisers are helping people to grow their wealth, protect their livelihood and plan for the future. I almost feel like all the hard work put in by the dedicated majority is tarnished by a few rogues.

Now that&#8217;s not to say that there aren&#8217;t systematic issues within a particular organisation (which the investigation certainly highlighted) or that the industry is perfect. The irony is that whilst the industry could use reform, most planners I know and work with already operate best practices that would be suggested by any reform.

Concerning an inappropriate life insurance policy being sold to a client, the adviser is clearly in the wrong. All professionals owe their clients a fiduciary duty and, legally, advisers are required to always act in the best interests of their clients. To recommend a client replace their insurance solely because doing so would result in a commission to the adviser is unethical and unconscionable. Thankfully in the case highlighted, the court agreed and the family will receive their insurance payout.

There is however a sales culture within the industry and this is natural. All you have to do is <a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/asic/pdflib.nsf/LookupByFileName/rep224.pdf/$file/rep224.pdf" target="_blank">look at the statistics around those who need financial advice and those who receive it</a>. There is a massive demand that is just not currently being met. The banks are well positioned to meet that demand and help those people who need it. The problem is that in order to get that message out to the world is a sales activity. And at the end of the day, a professional adviser needs to be compensated for their time and expertise. None of this is terribly surprising but I think that the &#8216;sales&#8217; activities of planners came across as being somewhat dirty or wrong in the report. This simply isn&#8217;t the case.

That said, there is a strong industry wide push to move towards fee-for-service planning where advisers do not receive any commission at all. This is an important reform and helps make the remuneration of planners much more transparent but comes with its own challenges of having to help clients understand the value of the services they are receiving. And for some reason, the services of a financial planner seem somewhat less valued by society than say the services of a surgeon.

Another point was raised in the program, albeit indirect and very subtle &#8211; ageism. I hate to say it, but the biggest disadvantage I have at the moment to having a strong career in financial planning is my age. Clients want experienced professionals with strong technical knowledge and firm ethics. Apparently this is proven by grey hair and wrinkles.

Proving myself to prospective clients is a challenge for me and something I need to work on over the next few years. Thankfully I&#8217;m positioned perfectly career-wise to tackle this, along with my personal strategy to work on my &#8216;street-cred&#8217;. But it is amusing that the same people who express a dislike for the sales culture within the industry are often the same people who look for decades of experience when choosing an adviser. Obviously not realising that the decades old advisers have work most of their career in an environment driven by commission and conflicted remuneration. Compared to a younger generation who have known only fee-for-service.

Of course, I am not trying to play down the benefit of life experience and I&#8217;m a big believer in the &#8216;school of hard knocks&#8217;. But I think as a society we need to value more highly the technical abilities of the younger along with their diligence and dedication to get the job done well.

Often, age and experience is simply used to open a door and build rapport with the client. And that is perhaps the worst and most perverse outcome from this ageism. It&#8217;s one thing to have life experience which is relevant and valuable to a client&#8217;s own experiences, but to just use that experience as a tick of approval without having it applicable to the client&#8217;s situation, in my opinion, adds no value.
