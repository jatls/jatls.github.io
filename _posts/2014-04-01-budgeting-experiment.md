A new month has just begun and I&#8217;m going to use the month of April to document my budgeting. I hope that this will help give you an insight in to my budgeting process and also show you just how little effort managing a budget can be when done bit by bit.

Today, being the first, I have set budgets for our household for April. Firstly, I set our savings for the month. By saving first, we stay on track with our goals and pick up any &#8220;slack&#8221; through other areas of the budget. Next, all of the fixed expenses/budgets are rolled over from last month. This covers the bulk of our income for the month (the income earned in March) and means our mortgage and bills are accounted for. Finally, I set budgets for any personal expenditure, ensuring an allocation is made to a &#8220;discretionary&#8221; budget for my wife and I. This is like an allowance that we each have free reign over and can use to spend as we see fit.

The above sounds like I&#8217;ve done this all on my lonesome which, in practical terms I do. I primarily manage the budget however both my wife and I have put input into the budget process and work on allocating any surplus appropriately. At the moment, we&#8217;ve just returned from holidays and a couple of months of lower income so things are tighter than usual so there&#8217;s less to negotiate. Also, we&#8217;ve been doing this for quite some time now together and we&#8217;re both on the same page with our budget categories and the amounts to be allocated to each category. Budgeting is still a collaborative process we work at together.Â If you are setting your budget for the first time, make sure you involve your significant other.

Time taken today: **15 mins**.

Now it&#8217;s your turn to make a budget for April. Start by noting down your expenses for April and allocate an amount to each category to cover that expense. Make sure you stick to your anticipated income for April (or your actual income in March depending on your current situation/bank balance).
