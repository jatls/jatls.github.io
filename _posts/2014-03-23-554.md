<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">This article is related to a trick I learnt early on in life &#8211; to measure wealth based on the time it would save you from paid work. You are </span><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">rich</em><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> when you have more passive income from your investments than you have regular expenditure. You can effectively live indefinitely without any additional work on your part.</span>

This is the basic Cashflow 101 principle and is a really good way to think about wealth and investing for the future. The article below just expands on that and links it to your ongoing savings goals.

> Many of us have some kind of plan in place to save money. However you label them, it’s easy to forget that most of our long-term savings have one goal in mind: to buy us time.
