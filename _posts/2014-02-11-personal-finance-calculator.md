Some friends came over last weekend and we all enjoyed a game of <a href="http://www.richdad.com/apps-games/cashflow-101.aspx" target="_blank">Cashflow 101</a> together. This was their first game and they both learnt a lot from the game. It also generated some questions and provided some ideas for future posts here.

For now, I thought I would share the <a href="http://www.richdad.com/Resources/Tools.aspx#personal-financial-calculator" target="_blank">Personal Finance Calculator</a> developed by the creators of the Cashflow 101 game. For those who have played the game, you should be familiar with the format. For those who have studied accounting you should already know this. For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, the calculator is simple enough for you to follow through. Fill in the blanks and the spreadsheet will give you some results as a snapshot on how you are doing financially.

Of course, these tools are only indicative but certainly this will help you get a handle on all your assets and liabilities, income and expenses. This is also something that you should review regularly since your financial position changes over time. Perhaps each new year or each financial year, set aside some time to review how you have performed in the last year and to check you are on track to meet your financial goals.

If the calculator creates questions, feel free to ask away or post them in the comments here and I will help explain things further.
