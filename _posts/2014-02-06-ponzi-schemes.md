You may already be familiar with Ponzi schemes or other get rich quick schemes but I think it’s important to think about these schemes, how they work, why they work and what lessons we can take away from them as careful investors.

So let’s face it, money causes a lot of angst and worry for everyone. Economics studies the most efficient ways to use our limited resources and behavioural finance tells us why we don’t do what economists tell us. But ultimately, all this thinking and talking about money comes down to people having to choose. And we dream about not having to make that choice &#8211; about having that little bit extra so we don’t need to compromise.

We’ve already talked about how easy access to credit and a sense of immediate gratification has lead to money trouble for young people and for them, a desire to be rich or financially secure stems from the need to repay debt. In short, we are all looking for that magic bullet that will solve our financial worries. Enter the get rich quick scheme.

Now, there are a lot of different schemes out there and even more businesses that rely on people wanting more money or to understand some secret that will take away their troubles. A Ponzi scheme is just one example that we will look at and hopefully take away some lessons which can equally be applied to any scheme.

### A Ponzi

Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi who ran these schemes in the 1920s &#8211; although he didn’t invent the idea. Basically, rather than paying returns to investors from investment returns, the capital of the company or investment from new investors are used to pay out existing (older) investors. Obviously this is unsustainable since once the new investment dries up, the company can no longer pay returns to the investors. While these schemes promise high returns they are actually designed only to benefit the early investors.

Pyramid schemes are similar in the sense that they are reliant on new members joining to fund the ongoing returns of the existing members. All these types of schemes are based on fraudulent principles, many are illegal and all should be avoided.

### Too good to be true

There is a simple adage which can help you make wise investment decisions.

> &#8220;If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.&#8221;

Do your homework. Be critical of promises and sales patter. Read reviews and get opinions from family, friends and colleagues. Often times someone who is disconnected from the situation can see things you cannot (that’s inherent in the nature of the sales process for these schemes and not a failing of the individual).

Remember, these schemes work by making outrageous promises, packaging them up in to a believable program and then letting your dreams, greed and imagination do the rest. Taking a second to step back and sceptically re-examining any claims made can certainly save you time, money and heartache.

It truly breaks my heart to hear stories of good, average people who have become caught up in these schemes, invested their hard earned savings and lost the lot. And all of this could have been avoided if they talked it over with a friend, did some calculations (even back of the envelope calculations are enough to disprove most of these schemes) or just asked that critical question &#8211; is this too good to be true?

### Where’s the profit?

This is another good question to ask yourself when assessing a potential investment option or scheme. How does the business or scheme derive income? Obviously a Ponzi scheme doesn’t actually generate income to pay shareholders but instead relies upon new capital to pay existing members. But sometimes, Ponzi’s hide or are camouflaged in jargon and technical detail.

You might be surprised to read this, but all businesses have, at their core, a very simple model for generating revenue. Generally this can be summarised in a single sentence or maybe even a few words. So thinking like this can help you to quickly identify a scheme that might be not quite legitimate. It’s not definitive but it certainly helps &#8211; and also gives you a better understanding of business in the long term because you will tend to focus on understanding how a business profits when you interact with them as a customer.

### Don’t get rich … get smart

Thinking here specifically of network marketing schemes which can be the backbone of successful businesses; they tend to work best by helping their participants to learn new skills. It can be difficult to get an opportunity when you don’t already have prior experience. A business opportunity could give you those skills. So when assessing a potential investment opportunity or scheme, think about what non-monetary benefits you can gain from the scheme.

A true Ponzi scheme (or get rich quick scheme) offers nothing that helps your personal development but just the promise and illusion of great wealth.

Using these tools, you should be able to see through the hype of a new scheme and find strong, legitimate investment opportunities or at least have a few extra tricks to help avoid dodgy operators. I promise you that one of the best roads to riches is to not give away your hard earned cash to disreputable investment schemes.
