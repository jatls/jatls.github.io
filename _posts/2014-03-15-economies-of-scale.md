The other day, I was at the supermarket checkout and overheard a pair of women discussing organic food. One woman raised the point that if the organic farmer was not using pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals to grow their food then the end product should be cheaper for the consumer (less inputs equates to less cost). I&#8217;m paraphrasing here &#8211; I know that real people don&#8217;t talk like that. But it did highlight that lots of people don&#8217;t understand the key economic principle of *economies of scale* (that is relevant here although the true story is more complex).

First of all, let&#8217;s look at the general rule. A company decides how much of a given product to produce based on the cost of production. As production increases, overall costs decrease (since a companies total costs are a combination of fixed and variable costs. Looking at the graphs below, the first curve (ATC1) represents the Average Total Cost of production for a company of their first factory. ATC2 shows the Average Total Cost of production if the company produced in two factories &#8211; and so on. In the short run, the company must fall on one of these curves and they will aim for the lowest point. But in the long run, each of the individual curves combine to produce the Long Run Average Cost curve.

The LRAC curve is just a composite of the short run curves but helps the company to easily identify their lowest cost of production over the long run. In this case, the firm achieves the minimum efficient scale at the low point of ATC3 and so should produce from 3 factories to maximise returns. When the LRAC is downward sloping, the company is said to achieve economies of scale &#8211; costs are decreasing as production increases. When the LRAC is upward sloping, the opposite is true.

In summary, a company achieves economies of scale when the production of more products lowers their average total costs. You could compare this to buying your groceries in bulk. If you buy a larger quantity then you can often get a discount and reduce your average total costs for groceries.

So what&#8217;s going on in the case of our organic food grower. Thinking back to the start, the question was; if variable costs are lower (i.e. less pesticides used on crops) then average total cost should be lower resulting in a cheaper product for consumers. And we have just discussed how decreasing average total costs leads to economies of scale over the long run. So far, so good for our organic farmer.

The problem comes when you think about the means of farm production. In order to increase production, our organic farmer needs more land to grow on or to increase crop yield from the same amount of land. Extra land is expensive to buy or lease and could actually lead to increased average total costs (and diseconomies of scale) and increasing crop yield is very hard when you can&#8217;t use chemical agents as an aid. So the non-organic farmer has the benefit of greater crop yields and so can get more production from each acre (do we still use acres in Australia &#8211; may be hectares these days).

Now, the next issue arises when we consider homogeneity (same-ness). Organic food can vary substantially from farm to farm whilst non-organic food tends to be more similar between farms. In many cases, you couldn&#8217;t tell which farm produced your non-organic food without looking at the label but organic food you might notice those variations. Whether these variations are attractive or detractive for potential consumers, this organic produce would not be considered the *same* product in the marketplace. This matters since many farmers can pool their resources (land) and all grow the same crop to reduce their average total costs in the long run &#8211; but only if the products produced are homogeneous. Anything produced by a smaller operator with uniqueness to their product will face higher costs and must pass these on to consumers.

A good contrast here would be the McDonalds fast food chain. A Big Mac is the same, wherever you go in the world (the perfect economic world) meaning the key ingredients are also the same. Since these ingredients can be sourced in bulk from producers, a discount can be achieved as well as the fixed business costs being distributed over a larger number of total products produced and sold. Because of the homogeneity of their products, McDonalds has a great capacity for achieving economies of scale.

Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m not saying that McDonalds is better than fresh, organic produce, merely highlighting the importance of economies of scale to cost of production. This also helps explain why production becomes centralised overseas (think China, Taiwan, Bangladesh etc.) and why often times you can purchase a cheap item for less than the cost of the constituent materials. Economies of scale are incredibly important to understand if you want to make sense of modern, globalised business.
