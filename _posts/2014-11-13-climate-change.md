There is a lot of buzz about climate change at the moment, precipitated by the [news of an agreement between China and the US to reduce carbon emissions][1], something the world has been waiting for since Kyoto. Better late than never I suppose. And who could forget John Howard famously **not** signing the agreement simply because China and America weren&#8217;t going to sign.

There&#8217;s also a bit of noise (particularly with the media being so concerned about &#8220;unbiased&#8221; reporting) from climate change skeptics or deniers or whatever they call themselves these days. But despite the noise being made, I am going to assume that those people are in the minority. At least for arguments sake, we will take it that majority of the global population agree that humans are causing the climate to change and, linked to that, we all know the various solutions to solve this problem.

So why is it that we are only a handful of years away from 2020 and yet we still don&#8217;t have clear and decisive policies to (at least) control the problem? I think it comes down to money. While we know the solutions, no one wants to bear the cost of that solution. And this literal &#8220;passing of the buck&#8221; has meant years of inaction and indecision.

I honestly believe the only reason action is being taken now is because we have always had climate projections up to 2020 which has always been &#8220;the future&#8221;. Now, we have strong scientific evidence and consensus that unless there is a dramatic cut in emissions the climate will be vastly different by 2020 and, if we stay on our current trend, by 2050 the world could be a very different and very scary place. To put it in to context, assuming a retirement age of 65 (lol!) I will retire in 2052. So while it is a fair way away, it is most certainly within my life time.

But we have to choose whether the cost of fixing the problem is worthwhile. And unfortunately this is where the problems start. Someone suggests a carbon tax or emissions trading scheme and someone else disagrees; not that it wont work or fix the problem but simply that the cost of implementing that solution is too high. And not just in dollar terms of increased power bills for households, but having wider reaching impacts to the economy. Sadly, I have seen far too often, people who simply object to environmental policies on economic grounds then causing them to deny the science, the facts of climate change.

Fortunately, Australia is well positioned to capitalise on climate change given that we sit on the largest uranium reserves in the world. Again, this is a contentious environmental issue and brings its own challenges &#8211; like the fact that the largest uranium deposits are locked away underneath protected national park land. But a decision must be made, one way or the other. The global community must sit down and agree what is the price we are willing to pay to look after our environment. We must be mindful of developing countries who, for the most part, haven&#8217;t contributed to this problem &#8211; either through economic grants or assistance to transition immediately to a carbon free economy. There **will** be a cost and it wont be cheap &#8211; and that&#8217;s what scares people the most I think.

And this brings me back to a key lesson I learnt as a child. The words &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford it&#8221; do not exist. This phrase just closes your mind and stops you from thinking about alternative solutions. Instead, I was taught to ask the question &#8220;How can I afford it?&#8221; This pushes you to be creative and innovative and figure out a solution to the problem. Obviously this is easier when geo-politics aren&#8217;t involved, but the same principle applies. So instead of thinking that the cost of dealing with climate change is too great, we should instead be thinking of ways to innovate and coming up with more creative solutions to decide how we can afford it &#8211; and just make it happen.
