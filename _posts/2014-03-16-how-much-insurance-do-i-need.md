Managing risk is a key aspect of financial planning and through insurance we can transfer our risk to others for a fee. One of the key problems with arranging insurance however is a question of how much insurance do you need? Matters are further complicated with the sheer number of insurance policies and options available. Before I go any further, it&#8217;s vital that you seek appropriate professional advice around risk management. That said, below are some resources to help you calculate your insurance requirements as a starting point in your risk management plans.

### Home

If you own your own home, your building insurance will need to cover the cost to rebuild your home. It&#8217;s important to check the specific details of your policy so you are confident that if your house is completely destroyed in some catastrophe that it will be rebuilt to the same (or better) condition from when it was destroyed. Many people have made the mistake of insuring the amount of their outstanding mortgage balance or the amount they paid for the house only to find after a catastrophe that this amount is insufficient to cover the costs of rebuilding.

<a href="http://www.onepath.com.au/eCalc/eonepathbuildingcalc.aspx" target="_blank">This online calculator</a> will help you to estimate the cost of your building should you need to rebuild today. I did notice though that this calculator only works when you tell it the size of your home in square metres, it&#8217;s no good if you use the room chooser to calculate it. Maybe it&#8217;s a work in progress or just a bug.

### Contents

Under insurance of home contents is surprisingly common. I think the main reason for this is when you ask someone what would need to be replaced if their home and contents were destroyed, their mind immediately goes to the large, obvious items like white goods, furniture, TV&#8217;s, computers etc. Many people forget to include the cost to replace the smaller or less obvious items like crockery and cutlery, clothing, linen etc.

The best way to estimate your insurance needs is to do a full inventory of your contents. This can be very time consuming and difficult to keep up to date. An alternative is to use <a href="https://www.homecontents.com.au/index.php?c=web_intro&profile=suminsured" target="_blank">this online calculator</a> to estimate your appropriate level of insurance cover. It starts by asking you some basic questions and gives a rough estimate, but the true power is at the end it allows you to customise your contents room by room to hopefully give you a very accurate estimate and one that is personalised to your situation.

Also, look at the specifics of your insurance policy. Does it cover jewellery items and, if so, to what value? Do you have any collectable items? Are they covered by default? Anything which is special or important to you and **must** be replaced in the event of a claim should be specified on your policy. By specifying items (and their values) the insurance company must pay that amount for that item in the case of a claim. Otherwise you follow their default policy rules and you may find that your jewellery collection that is destroyed in a house fire is only insured up to $1,000 per item to a maximum of $10,000. No that&#8217;s not a real clause but yes it is similar to many contents insurance policies. So remember to specify items that are important and/or expensive.

### Motor Vehicles

Fortunately, most people have adequate cover for their motor vehicles and car insurance typically tends to be easier to understand &#8211; although it does still have its complexities. When looking at sum insured there are a couple of options. You can either insure an agreed value nominated by you (perhaps the financed amount outstanding, the price you initially paid or replacement value) or market value. Market value policies tend to be cheaper since, as the vehicle ages and depreciates, the sum insured naturally declines over time. Market value is calculated by the insurer at the time of a claim but you can get an idea of the market value based on <a href="http://www.redbook.com.au/" target="_blank">online databases like redbook</a>.

Another consideration for motor vehicle insurance is whether to insure your car comprehensively or just for third party damage (usually with fire/theft as an additional option). If your car is under finance you will usually find it is a clause of the finance agreement that the car must remained comprehensively insured for the term of the loan &#8211; so that&#8217;s a no brainer. If you own your car outright, you may decide to self insure and wear the cost if you crash your own car but still be covered in case you happen to damage someone else&#8217;s property in the process. Remember that in Australia, it is mandatory to have a basic level of insurance that covers you in case you cause personal injury to someone else with your car and this is covered as part of your vehicle registration process.

### Regular Review

Hopefully the above helps you to estimate your general insurance needs. Personal insurance is another matter entirely and we will go through that at a later stage.

The biggest mistake you can make with insurance though, is to set and forget. Insurance exists to transfer our risk to others so we can live comfortably in the knowledge that we are safe should the unfortunate happen. But as our circumstances change over time, so do the risks we face and our insurance needs. Major life changes are good reminders to review your situation but often we overlook the minor changes that happen gradually over time. These minor changes are the primary driver for under insurance so it is best to review your insurance policy every 2-3 years to make sure you are adequately protected.

You might also look for policies that have an indexation clause so the sum insured naturally increases with CPI over time. Although this isn&#8217;t perfect, it does help to address under insurance and can &#8216;bridge the gap&#8217; between your regular insurance reviews.
