Recently I have become more and more concerned about the nature of consumerism and its impact on personal finance, particularly its role in increasing personal debt.

### Good debt vs bad debt

The Baby Boomer generation learnt the lessons of the great depression from their parents and so developed ideas about debt being negative. If you could avoid debt, you should. And when you have no alternative, ensure the debt is repaid quickly. Only mortgages were regarded as acceptable debt for individuals simply because the cost of property as a proportion of annual income is high.

Nowadays attitudes have shifted because credit has become so easy to access (both technologically and in principle, as banks lend more to people) and complacency rules. Off the top of my head, the average credit card debt in Australia is $3,000. Certainly not as bad as the US however this is an average figure which undoubtedly is skewed towards the lower end due to Baby Boomers who carry no debt.

So the first thing to understand is the distinction between good debt and bad debt. Good debt is that used to purchase assets (investments) or as a tool for better cash flow management. Bad debt is everything else. Notice though that a credit card can be both good and bad debt depending on its usage.

### Age of Entitlement

Because of the more relaxed attitude towards debt in younger generations, a culture of immediate gratification has arisen. Coupled with the fact that young people see the standard of living of their friends and family and want to keep pace with them (donâ€™t get me wrong, this has always happened) pushes people towards debt.

In the past, if you wanted to travel overseas or buy a new car, you would save up a sufficient amount to cover the expense. The gratification was delayed. Now, same situation, you just get a loan so you can have your fun now and worry another paying later.

### Delayed Gratification

There is a way to teach children the joys of waiting and working hard towards a goal. The key is gardening.

If you plant a seed it will take time, care and work to ensure it grows up to flower and or fruit. I believe by teaching children about gardening, they learn important life skills relevant to finance without knowing it.

I specifically mentioned children but the same principles apply to adults, although typically more awareness of the principle is necessary in order for it to stick.

I have personally found that by maintaining a strong budget I have been able to reduce the seductive nature of instant gratification. What works for me might not work for you but living frugally is a good goal to have. Even struggling to live frugally is an improvement on living outside your means.
