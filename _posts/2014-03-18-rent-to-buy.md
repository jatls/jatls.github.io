In August 2012, I wrote [an open letter about a particular rent to buy firm][1]. The message (and my outrage) still stands and the business continues to grow as a franchise. I also came across [this similar article][2] today which also discusses the pitfalls (and exploitative behaviour) of rent to buy agreements. Their analysis is very good and they include a range of different product comparisons (unlike my letter where I have only gone for one item).

If you haven&#8217;t figured it out yet, I would **strongly** discourage anyone from engaging in a rent to buy arrangement without first doing their sums. As the Consumer Action article highlights, borrowing the same amount from a credit card at 20% interest still yields a dramatically cheaper result.

That said, I&#8217;m not against leasing arrangements or alternative forms of financing. In fact, I&#8217;m all for it when it works in your favour by providing value for money or additional features or benefits which aren&#8217;t available through other means (even if there is a marginal cost to you for the privilege). Ultimately, everyone has to assess their own individual circumstances and work out what best suits their needs and objectives. But typically, these rent to buy agreements exploit the most vulnerable often with luxury items they simply cannot afford.
