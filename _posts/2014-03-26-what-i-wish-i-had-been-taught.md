I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about financial literacy recently. Particularly imparting that knowledge to young people to help give them a foundation to use for the rest of their lives.

We all know that school doesn&#8217;t equip young people with the necessary financial skills but instead they must be learnt through trial and error in life. And that can often lead to problems and financial mistakes which end up haunting people well beyond their teenage and young adult lives. But in order to best do this, I need your help.

Can you please leave a comment like this. &#8220;When I was 15, I wish someone had told me &#8230; about money.&#8221;

I say 15, not as an arbitrary age but for a few reasons. Firstly, it is around 15 (or shortly after) that young people start to think about part time or casual work. Secondly, developmentally at 15 you have more than enough ability to learn anything and everything about money that you will need for the rest of life. Sure, there&#8217;s lots to learn but for everyday usage, you don&#8217;t need a PhD or anything. Finally, at age 15 you are most likely &#8220;safe&#8221; and being supported by your parents meaning you can use the income from your part time work or pocket money to experiment with investments without the risk of not being able to support yourself or family.

Okay, the above are generalisations but I think they hold true for most. So I need your help so I can work out exactly what I should be teaching young people that will most help them in life. I have some ideas but your feedback is vital. Your suggestions or recommendations can be something that you know now and have mastered but would have preferred if someone gave you the keys or knowledge without you having to learn it the &#8220;hard&#8221; way. Or maybe it&#8217;s something that you still don&#8217;t really understand but your life would have been made much easier if you had learnt about it when younger, even if only in part.
