I'm a little bit outraged this morning after reading a shocking "news" piece from the ABC about how [young workers need to be more savvy with their superannuation][1]. The article advocates for young people to cancel their "unnecessary" insurance cover which is both misleading and dangerous.

"The Federal Government requires employer-selected superannuation funds to provide two types of insurance cover, which are automatically deducted from members' accounts." The idea behind these default levels of insurance is to ensure that *everyone* has at least some level of protection automatically so in the event that they die prematurely or become totally and permanently disabled they, or their family, are less likely to be a burden on the state. And with the coming changes to insurance, I can see articles similar to this misleading and misinforming consumers to ultimately make horrible decisions.

To give you an idea on how well researched this article is, they refer to "One type of insurance cover is Total Disability Protection (TDP)" which is simply, factually wrong. TPD, or Total and Permanent Disability insurance is the term/acronym you are looking for and a very basic level of research would have highlighted this point. Put the quoted phrase in google and the first hit is [ASIC's money smart website][2] explaining the *correct* terminology and importance of this cover. Immediately this discredits the entire article as a poorly researched piece, turned in at 5:43pm on a Friday no doubt by a [junior reporter][3] who needs to keep their sub-editor happy.

>Good Super managing director Andrew MacLeod said the life insurance premium was particularly irrelevant for young workers.
>
>"I ask if you are 25 years old, with no dependent children, do you really need life insurance? The answer is, in your circumstances, probably not," Mr MacLeod said.

This quote is particularly misleading and I would imagine not necessarily the intended message from the CEO of a superannuation company which [provides and promotes insurance cover for their members][4]. Not to mention the subtle complexities which are ignored or unknown by the author. While I am happy to concede the premise that any person (young or old) with no dependants and no debt has a limited need for life insurance cover, the point overlooked here is that the majority of superannuation funds bundle life insurance and TPD insurance together. And I think we can all agree that a 25 year old who finds themselves unable to work in **any** occupation ever again due to an illness or injury has a huge need for cover to replace the lost wages for 40-50 years of work, to provide for their general living expenses and any special requirements such as home modifications or medical expenses. Most people do not have sufficient TPD cover in Australia with [underinsurance estimated at $1,258 million per year][5].

And just to be clear, the bundling of life and disability insurance together is not an insidious plot by the superannuation industry to collect fees for products their members don't actually need. In reality, premiums are kept low by pooling risks and the combination of these two (interrelated) insurance covers helps keep costs down for everyone insured.

I don't disagree that many people, particularly those starting their careers or working multiple jobs, have a higher risk of duplication of super accounts and by extension insurance cover. I obviously advocate for everyone to be aware of their various superannuation funds, the benefits provided by those funds and the costs associated with them. But it's important that people seek professional advice and properly assess their needs in light of all the facts rather than simply being told that they are paying for insurance cover which they do not require.

>Mr MacLeod said young people should be aware that while at some stage life insurance cover may be important, it was probably an unnecessary cost imposed at the start of their working life.
>
>"What we have in Australia is we are trying to solve an under-insurance problem at the old end of the spectrum by over-insuring young people at the bottom end of the spectrum," he said.
>
>"So the objective is right, but the solution is wrong."

If that is truly what Andrew MacLeod believes then surely he should allow members of his fund to take up more tailored insurance cover that is appropriate to their needs (i.e. TPD only cover for young people). But the commercial reality is that the cost of TPD only cover is only marginally lower than the cost of combined life and TPD insurance and so his fund continues to follow the industry standard.

But I'm thinking that once again the quotes have been shifted in their focus to push the author's agenda. [This media release from Good Super][6] has a similar message about the cost of surplus insurance on superannuation benefits (which is an important point to make and a strong reason for maintaining only one super policy with appropriate levels of cover) but with a subtle distinction. This media release is actually marketing for the fund dressed up as news or a public service.

"Good Super has already reached out to 40,000 Australians to get them to check the insurance coverage on their super to see if they are paying too much – or even too little." Aren't they the *good* guys here. Looking out for youngsters who might be hundreds of thousands of dollars worse off by having their super spread over many accounts, each with their own insurance cover. Why we should all just move our super to the *good* guys!

This type of media release marketing is common for industry super funds to attract and retain members and to position themselves as providing a public good while the large commercial providers are just out to "rip off unwitting Australians". To me, this is the wrong message to be sending and the mis-information presented does more harm than good. But worst of all, this undermines the value of personal insurance generally for consumers which is very dangerous given the insurance gap most Australians are currently unkowingly exposed to.
