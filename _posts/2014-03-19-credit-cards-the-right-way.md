Credit cards are important financial tools but, like all tools, can be abused and end up causing more harm than good. If you have ever struggled with credit card debt then you will know this first hand.

Growing up, I was taught my parents baby boomer wisdom of never buying something you didn&#8217;t have the money for &#8211; no matter how you financed it. It was this lesson that lead to so much trepidation and procrastination before moving out of home with my gorgeous wife.

See, when I was studying at Uni, I moved out of home to live with a friend much closer to school (a 20 minute walk compared to a 90 minute train ride) but as a student didn&#8217;t have any income at all. I was fortunate that living with a close friend afforded me some flexibility with paying my way. I had some money saved up from working over summer holidays and other casual jobs that had cropped up over the years but I wasn&#8217;t entitled to any social security or student support payments because of my parent&#8217;s assets (the rules at the time didn&#8217;t consider an 18 year old living financial independently of their parents to be actually independent). I found a part time job fairly quickly which gave me a modest income that I could use to feed myself, help keep the roof over my head (albeit significantly subsidised by my amazing friend) and pay the bills. There was a little bit left over for some &#8216;toys&#8217; but I wasn&#8217;t the kind of student who went out drinking every night after class so I allowed myself my vice.

I was shocked when my bank wrote to me at this time offering me a student credit card. Here I was, without a penny to rub together and the bank was going to offer me access to $500 for free. Okay, even in those days $500 was not a lot of money &#8211; but to me it was heaps! And even better was the price, since I was a student at the time, the fees were waived and I was given 30 days interest free. I&#8217;m not one to pass up free things!

Having this credit card was wonderful. Being a $500 limit, I knew that I could easily repay the full amount in one month given my income at the time. I also knew that this card would give me the flexibility to time my payments for household items better. I could go shopping before being paid and as long as I budgeted right, I would have enough money to repay the balance before being charged interest. This helped free up cash to pay bills and alike. This was my pre-budgeting period.

To cut a long story short, after Uni, I moved back home with my dad, met my wife to be, started working full time for a modest wage but without any of the outgoings I had previously. The freedom of being able to earn an income and save most of it was invigorating. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; courting my wife was a costly endeavour (as was the wedding) and no expense was spared. I was young and had cash to burn. I think of this as my dark ages. I didn&#8217;t care so about budgeting or properly monitoring my spending since I knew that my next pay cheque was never far away and would easily replenish my &#8216;play&#8217; money.

Well the first reality check came in the form of me quitting my modestly paid job on a whim. There were lots of reasons that don&#8217;t really need discussing but needless to say going from a lifestyle where nothing felt too expensive to having no income and having to live frugally &#8211; that hit home. Oh, and to make matters worse, this was about 6 months before our wedding and my (now) wife was studying at the time. This pressure forced us to think very carefully about budgeting and was the start of our budgeting period.

The second reality check came when we had a big fight over moving out. Just before our wedding, we both were living out of two bedrooms at my dad&#8217;s house with my wife making trips home every few days to replenish her overnight bag. This wasn&#8217;t an ideal situation and the pressure of not having our own space put an unnecessary strain on our relationship. And weddings. They do that too. Needless to say, we had seemingly endless aspirations and no income between us. Something had to change.

Fortune was with us both as we managed to secure new jobs and started some income flowing. Saving like maniacs was key since we had the goal of moving out around the same time as our wedding. Renting was the only viable option but I was still very nervous about having enough money to make ends meet. We had to budget properly and immediately. Thankfully we had some time at home to prepare before hand. We settled in to our new jobs, saved up what we could (around the wedding expenses) and tracked every cent. We also went to the bank and applied for a new credit card. This time, the limit was much greater (about 5 times my student card) but still reasonable given our income. We were no longer students so still had to pay an annual card fee; except that the bank would waive the annual fee if we spent more than $10,000 a year on the card. At first, that seemed ridiculous and impossible to achieve but since we had been tracking our expenditure, we could plan ahead.

Our strategy was to pay for all our household expenses (as many as possible) on to this card. Our estimation was that simply groceries and personal household expenditure would be enough to exceed that limit and save us on fees. And it worked! For the life of the card, we have never paid an annual card fee.

But we also had to manage the interest charges. It was no good saving $50 a year on the card fee, if we ended up paying $50 per month in interest. And this is where the budget ties back in. By having a robust budget, we can confidently spend money on credit since we know the cash for our purchase is waiting patiently in our bank account. The credit card is a tool for making the purchase but simply draws on the balance we hold in cash. Each month, the balance is repaid in full saving on any interest charges and because of the amount transacted through the card, we avoid any annual card fee. Perfect!

As you can see, the budget and credit cards work together to help us meet our goals.

Having the knowledge that the money we are borrowing on the credit card is basically our own money sitting in another account gives us certainty around making purchase decisions and flexibility to time our purchases when we need them, instead of being tied to a pay cycle. And today we have gone one step further.

To make sure we are never charged interest on our credit cards, we have set up (as of today) an automatic repayment facility. Each month, on the due date, the bank will draw the required balance from our account to repay the card in full. Up to this point we had managed it manually so we could better respond to changes in our circumstances (and just in case the budget failed). But now, we have confidence in the budget and our money management. We know that when the bills need to be paid, the money is there and it can be drawn automatically. This frees up more of our time to better track our spending and budget more effectively.

Unfortunately both banks we have cards with didn&#8217;t openly or widely advertise the availability of this option. Particularly when the automatic payment was made from another institution. But as far as I know, all banks have this ability so it might just be a matter of asking the question of them. You will most likely need to fill out some forms (as we did) to set it all up. If all your banking is with one institution then you might be lucky enough to be able to set up the automatic repayment through online banking.

Now, I realise that some people reading this might not be able to repay the full balance on the due date each month. An automatic repayment can still help you. If you are working to pay down an existing credit card debt then you can set up an automatic payment for a fixed amount each month to be drawn and to take out the human element of manually transferring funds to the card. Sometimes this can be the hardest part of repaying debt &#8211; ending up with little money in your account.

This might not work for everyone and every circumstance, but it is a little used feature of credit cards that can help to better manage your repayments. If the situation is right it can save you lots of time and maybe even interest too for those times when you forget to make repayment before the due date.
