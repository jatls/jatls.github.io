Welcome to the new year. This is one of the times people think a lot about money &#8211; mostly due to the fact that they are anticipating a sizable tax return. And when you are living from pay cheque to pay cheque, a sudden inflow of funds is always readily accepted. Even if you are budgeting properly, it&#8217;s still nice. But this reminds me of a facebook status post I read recently.

I don&#8217;t remember the exact words, but the gist of it was that they were upset because the government had assessed this person&#8217;s income and deemed it too high to receive a particular benefit (family tax benefit or alike). Obviously, living from week to week, this reduction in income was a shock to their family finances and the only way to mange this was to make sacrifices to compensate.

Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, raising a family is tough and costly. Kids are like little money pits. And I feel for this person being in this predicament. But I am stuck wondering what is considered a high income? Obviously it&#8217;s subjective and based a lot on lifestyle choices. But when the government draws a line in the sand and declares a set figure as a &#8216;high&#8217; income, generally I don&#8217;t regard their chosen figure as being unreasonable or &#8216;low&#8217;. So for this person to have their benefits cut means that they are on (at least) a reasonable income.

The true issueÂ here is whether or not the family is living within their means or saving for a rainy day. The first point is something that I think we struggle with in Australia, particularly Gen Y. Cheap and easy credit has allowed us to grow accustomed to mod-cons without having to worry too much about how we will eventually pay for them. I think also part of it stems from aspiring to have similar wealth and status as the Baby Boomer generation. The irony is that the Baby Boomer generation relied on savings, not credit, to attain wealth. They also (typically) lived frugally in order to save and then take iterative steps towards the lifestyle they desired. Rather than just paying for everything on credit &#8211; in essence living the lifestyle while paying for it.

The other point is around saving for a rainy day. Every budget should have an emergency fund. Every household should expect the unexpected and make plans. Saving a small amount regularly lets you build a buffer to help cover unexpected expenses and ensure that your household finances stay on track. And this emergency fund can protect against lost income as equally as it can extraordinary expenses. The key to money management is a solid plan &#8211; and this must allow for plan b, c and d just in case.

So when you think about the end of financial year and your upcoming tax return; ask yourself if you have a backup plan and if not, come up with one. And rather than using that inflow of cash to buy some new luxuries, use it to help your financial plans along whether that be paying down debt, boosting your savings or establishing an emergency fund. Good luck, and happy new year!
