Previously, I worked in the vehicle leasing industry and had to guide people through the fairly complex rules regarding tax and finance that impacted on their vehicle lease.  It was an interesting and challenging job but what was strange is that technically our company did not provide financial advice to its clients (since our company didn’t make any specific recommendations around a financial product).  We did however suggest clients obtain independent financial advice before entering in to any leasing arrangement through our company.  Now, working in the financial planning industry, I can look back on those suggestions from a different perspective.

A financial adviser is licensed to provide financial product advice related to specific areas, typically superannuation, insurance and investments.  The industry is still in the process of moving from commission based fees to fee-for-service models and as such, many advisers will limit their advice to the areas which generate them revenue (superannuation, insurance and investments).  There are also strict regulations around what constitutes advice and how an adviser must behave when acting on behalf of a licensee, often with restrictions around the provision of advice in certain areas.  Because of this, there may be clients who are unable to obtain appropriate advice around important specialist areas of personal finance (such as leasing) to their detriment.

### The true meaning of advice

I see one of the roles of financial advice as being a means to increase financial literacy in the community.  Unfortunately this role is often disregarded or ignored in order to boost sales or revenue &#8211; again to the detriment of both client and adviser.

In my opinion, an adviser should take their client by the hand and guide them through the financial minefield.  In the process the client should become more financially literate and savvy; which will flow on to increased wealth and a greater requirement for expert advice.  Client satisfaction will also likely increase since the advice relationship is built on a strong base of trust, education and help.

I think perhaps a reason this model hasn’t been widely adopted by firms is that it is both time consuming for the adviser and costly for the client.  Both these points require a reality check.  Firstly, the adviser should be prepared to invest the required time and energy handling their client’s affairs. After all, the adviser is being well compensated. Secondly, clients must come to terms with the true cost of advice.  Admittedly I am talking about a premium ongoing service here but I think that should be the standard for the industry &#8211; we are after all in a relationship building profession.  Once clients receive a quality service and see the benefits and value of it, the cost of the service is more justifiable.  A case in point is engaging a solicitor; it is costly on a per hour basis but the relationship, experience, knowledge and protection is worth every cent.

In order to maintain this kind of service, there also needs to be adequate support, tools and training for advisers.  Without the background support a holistic service is not feasible given the level of involvement and work required from the adviser.  Particularly when dealing with areas of finance that the adviser may not themselves be completely abreast of.  As I have been taught, it’s not about knowing everything but knowing enough to be able to identify the client’s needs and then facilitating the correct advice is delivered to the client, even if this means referring to other professionals or seeking external assistance.

Now is the defining time for the financial planning industry and it is crucial that the industry collectively make the most of this opportunity and rather than just create a “money machine”, instead build a service industry that has real benefits for the community.  The hard work now will certainly pay dividends in to the future.
