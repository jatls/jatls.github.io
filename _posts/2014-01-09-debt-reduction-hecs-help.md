HELP debts (formally HECS) are Australian government sponsored student loans. Unlike other debt, HELP debts have some special features making them one of the best loans available.  Calling this debt a loan is misleading as its features distinguish it from other forms of debt, as we will see, and so HELP debts are best considered as a voluntary taxation regime.

### Interest rate

HELP debts incur no interest (0% rate) making them advantageous over other student loans.  You must meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for these loans as they are funded directly by the Australian government.  Each year, the balance outstanding is indexed with CPI in order to keep pace with inflation.

### Minimum repayment

Repayments are made to the Australian Taxation Office as part of your income tax return at the end of each financial year.  Your employer will withhold an additional amount to cover your liability if you request it.

Repayments are calculated based on the table below based on your gross annual salary reported on your tax return and start at 4%.  Unlike income tax, this is a flat rate and so once you exceed the threshold, repayment is required on your gross salary multiplied by the relevant repayment percentage.

### Death of borrower

Upon the death of the borrower, the debt is cancelled and no liability rests with the estate.  This is because the debt is incurred to pay for further studies to enhance employment prospects.  If you have a debt outstanding upon death then it is most likely because your studies didn’t help you to obtain employment utilizing your qualifications (yes this is judged purely on monetary terms but is indexed with inflation.

### Early repayment

Early voluntary repayment is available if you wish.  While this used to attract a discount it no longer does.  This leaves little incentive to repay this debt.

### Strategies

When considering debt reduction strategies, the rule of thumb is to focus your repayment efforts on the debt that carries the highest interest rate first and then progressively work through all your debts.  Because of the nature of HELP debts, the best strategy is to make only the minimum repayment due to the 0% interest rate.

However, given that the debt is interest free, even if you have surplus cash flow that could be used to make additional repayments, this would not be beneficial.  The reason for this is that you have the opportunity to use that surplus cash flow to invest and earn interest and/or capital growth.  As long as your investment outperforms the CPI inflation rate, your overall Net Worth will increase by focusing your surplus cash flow on investing rather than reducing your HELP debt.

### The Future

The future of HELP debts is uncertain given the current state of the federal budget, the increasing pressure on the public purse related to an ageing population and changes to our expectations of education.  The federal government is considered proposals to privatise existing and future HELP debts which could dramatically change this landscape.

The important point here is that those eligible should obtain a HELP debt as appropriate and those with existing HELP debts should follow a strategy which maximises the benefit obtained.  If you are considering a family, it may be worthwhile to establish a saving and investment regime for your children’s education as such government funded programs may not exist by the time they are ready to start higher education (think US style college fees).
