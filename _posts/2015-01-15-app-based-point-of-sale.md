Running a small business is a tough game, particularly in the retail industry. Competition is high and the larger players often overwhelm the smaller, newer entrants. There are also some significant barriers to entry in to the retail space but it&#8217;s great to see technology stepping in to help solve problems and increase competition.

Once upon a time, a retailer would need to invest in a bulky (and costly) point-of-sale (POS) system; whether that be a simple cash register or a complex, customised touch screen set up. These days, with as little as a tablet computer and a free app business owners can have a POS system up and running in minutes. Many will email receipts to customers, integrate in to accounting packages, maintain inventory, link to payment processing services &#8211; whether web based or otherwise, and offer sales analytics.

I have seen a fair few apps around that do this job, but have had the chance to play with <a href="https://squareup.com/global/en-gb/register" target="_blank">Square Register</a>. It&#8217;s quite polished and offers a wide range of features for retailers and could easily be tailored to suit a hospitality business or even a simple service company (freelance designer etc). It certainly wont be everything to everyone, but it&#8217;s a great entry level option and perfect for a start up. And it also has a web interface for administration and reporting.

It&#8217;s marvellous to see how technology can take what used to be a barrier and transform it in to an opportunity. I see apps like these as being a great help to smaller retail businesses who operate primarily out of swap meets or markets or even their garage. It unlocks potential that otherwise was only available to more established players.
