Today was a fairly important day in my career. I am now officially on the front line of a commercial financial practice &#8211; albeit in a support role at this stage. While I loved working in paraplanning and I had a great team to work with, the back office is just too far removed from the front line; from giving advice. And my new role comes with some extra benefits too.

Firstly and foremost, I am no longer bound to the head office and because the commercial practice covers the whole of the Melbourne metro area, it looks like I will have a few options on where I&#8217;m going to be located. Fingers crossed it&#8217;s close to home (as in 10 mins close) but either way I&#8217;ll still be closer than the CBD where I was. Another benefit is that I will be working directly with some of the best financial planners in Melbourne. They can mentor me and (hopefully) I can impress them and build my network further. Having allies amongst this practice is a huge win all by itself. Finally, my new manager is proving to be very good and &#8220;hands off&#8221; which is great. It means the team I will be working with are all motivated and driven people who don&#8217;t need the proverbial whip cracking to get them on task.

It has only been one day, so there&#8217;s going to be more to discover and a lot more to learn. But so far, this is proving to be the best career decision I&#8217;ve ever made. Next stop, building a book of clients!
