Without knowing it, you are probably already familiar with the time value of money.  If I offerred to give you $100 now or $100 in one year’s time, which would you prefer?  Or perhaps even think back to when you were younger and compare the price you paid for a soft drink to what you would pay today.  As we will see, the principles of the time value of money are fairly simple but are vital to understanding finance.

### The investment option

Take our first example &#8211; cash now or later.  Chances are you made the smart choice of taking the cash now since it felt like the right thing to do.  You may have considered “better in my pocket than yours” or you may have thought about the importane of the money now being greater than the future.  All these reactions are deeply rooted in the time value of money.

Let’s compare both options to see which one is truely the best option. If you get $100 now and don’t spend it you have $100. Fine. But leave it in a savings account for a year and how much do you have?  Probably more than $100 &#8211; let’s say $105 for round figures. That means, over the year, you have managed to earn 5% interest on this cash.  The other alternative is to get $100 on a years time.  Hopefully it’s obvious to you that this $100 is less than our alternative $105.

Because we can invest our capital it is expected that over time our capital will increase in value. If we are presented with an investment option that doesn’t grow or grows too slowly we are unlikely to accept it.

But we can only compare our investment options by assessing them at the same point in time.  The $100 example is trivial however it can get complex quickly; say if you are comparing as lump sum payment with an income stream.  Understanding the time value of money gives you tools that can be used to make these decisions quickly and easily without guessing.

### The inflation option

The second example comes at the same concept from a different angle.  As we all know from first hand observations, consumable goods typically increase in price over time &#8211; we call this inflation.  Or in other words, our purchasing power is eroded over time so the value of the goods we can buy with a fixed amount of money, over time, will be less and less.  So $100 today will not buy $100 worth of goods tomorrow due to inflation.

This still leads us to the same conclusion just in the other direction.  It is therefore important to identify and differentiate between future value and present value.  In our earlier example with the $100, we calculated the future value of the first option to compare with the second option (a like for like comparison).  In this case we would instead be calculating the present value of a particular good from a given future value.  The calculation is similar for both and I won’t bore you with the maths (there are much better maths texts out there covering this) or you can use a financial calculator or excel to save you arithmetic.

These calculations are basically what is used to determine mortgage payments.  From the lender’s perspective, the loan is simply a future payment stream and they tweak the variables (loan amount, term, repayments) to ensure they earn an acceptable interest rate for their risk.  Understanding this allows you to get some insight into your mortgage and can help you to predict the impact of interest rate fluctuations on your mortgage repayment.  So while I may have sounded a little vague in my description, this is a very real principle that impacts everyone.

### Putting it together

In the real world, inflation and investments interact with each other resulting in interest income being classified as either nominal or real.  Nominal interest is the headline rate (5% we used before in our $100 example) while real interest is after adjusting the interest for inflation.  Basically, in the time it took us to earn that interest, prices have increased also.  If we made a poor investment choice then the purchasing power of our money could still have decreased.

As you can see, these models are simplistic but they illustrate key principles about finance.  The true power comes from combining models and adding new levels of complexity to be able to make accurate predictions about the future.  Even still, sometimes the simplest model can be the most useful as it only takes a few inputs to get a fairly accurate picture and adding more complexity only refines that picture rather than changing it dramatically.
