I have been thinking recently why people might struggle to stick to their budgets. Assuming all expenses are captured by the budget and no unexpected expenses come up then there is no reason why the budget cannot be followed. But as it happens, people will still overspend above what they have budgeted. And so you review the next month and adjust accordingly and then overspending still occurs. Well I think I’ve figured out why, and it comes down to perceptions.

### How much money do you have?

It’s a personal question but somewhere in your mind you have a rough figure of how much cash you have ready to spend if you needed to. And if you don’t know that figure you just log in to online banking and look it up. Except, you’re wrong and so is your bank.

What your bank doesn’t know about is your budget and your commitments.

Let’s say you have rent of $300 per week due each Friday. Given today is Tuesday, you have $500 in your account and you have just been paid, how much money do you have?

### How much money do you really have?

Above is a very simple example to illustrate my point but the same principle applies to a more complex situation with bigger numbers and more categories. You can only spend the amount you have allocated to each budget category on that category. If you overspend then you will not be able to meet your other obligations.

By thinking about the money you have in categories you force yourself to make smart (sometimes tough) decisions on consumption. Without this mechanism you feel free to spend until your bank balance hits zero; and by then it’s too late.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, when you have a zero bank balance, you tend not to spend money. So all we’re doing is using our budget categories as mini bank balances. If they are zero, no spending! By simply changing the way you look at your available funds, you have the power to control your spending, eliminate bill stress and enjoy more of the things you love.

Give it a try.
