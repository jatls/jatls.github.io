  Interesting development from the ATO. Whilst e-tax is not the most whiz-bang of apps, it certainly gets the job done and makes lodgement as simple as possible. MyTax proves to simplify this even further and make lodgement more accessible too. Keep in mind it&#8217;s only really suitable for simple returns but should still suffice for most.
