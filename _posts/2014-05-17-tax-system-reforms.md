After the release of the federal budget, it seems everyone is talking about the economy and personal finance. In one recent discussion, I outlined my personal recommendation for the income tax system and I realised I hadn&#8217;t actually put this thought in to writing. So here goes!

We should scrap any payments directly to individuals from the government (with the exception of some social security benefits like NewStart, Age Pensions etc which can only be administered that way). The principle here is rather than paying people a rebate or giving them an offset, they will be entitled to a &#8220;personalised&#8221; tax rate. The current bracketed tax structure aims for equality &#8211; those on lower incomes share less of the tax burden. But after this, we still provide some people with additional payments which further adjust their effective income tax rate. Because of this each person in the country pays a different effective rate of tax.

My proposal is for the ATO to assess you based on your circumstances and then apply a single percentage rate of tax to you. If you are entitled to a family tax benefit or a low income earner offset, then this just adjusts your effective tax rate. This makes the tax system easier to understand and clear to individuals how much tax they are paying.

Does this sound like a more effective system to you? What would you do to improve the tax system?
