So as most of you would be aware, interest-free deals are all over the place. Typically available at point of sale as new credit card sign ups. ASIC has recently <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools/interest-free-deal-calculator" target="_blank">released a calculator</a> to help you work out what repayments you would need to make in order to clear the debt before the interest-free period runs out. This is really helpful in order for you to maximise the benefit you get from interest-free finance deals.

Interest-free deals can be a great way to save money and have what you want now but what you may not know is that interest-free finance does indeed have an implied interest rate.

Back in my undergraduate studies, we looked at a case study of a prominent retailer where you would receive a discounted price for your purchase if you paid for the item in full with cash (instead of financing the purchase). I’ll save you the maths involved, but effectively it’s just a *simple* time value of money calculation to work out what the implied interest rate is. Knowing this allows you to work out the opportunity cost involved and you may discover that you have access to cheaper finance through another provider.

Another example of this would be a rent to buy arrangement for household furniture, white goods or luxury items. It follows the exact same principles except there is a regular monthly payment. There is an interest rate built into the finance but because of the nature of the agreement it doesn’t need to be disclosed. Often times it would be cheaper to get a pay-day loan (which are notoriously exorbitant) than to rent to buy through one of these schemes. But you would never know unless you crunch the numbers.

In short, online calculators can help you by taking out the difficulty with the formulas and maths involved. And a great place to start is the <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools" target="_blank">ASIC MoneySmart website</a>. Feel free to comment if you can’t find a calculator on there that you would find useful and I can see what I can do to create one for you.
