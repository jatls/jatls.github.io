This is a really good question. The first point is that the tax rules are the same for business and individuals. The difference however is that businesses have more flexibility with their accounting which opens up the door for more advanced tax planning and reduced tax liability. Also, businesses tend to spend more money on accountants and, unsurprisingly, accountant fees are tax deductible. If you have an accountant complete your tax return, they will automatically claim the deduction for their fees on your behalf &#8211; how kind.

### Allowable Deductions

The general principle with deductions is that payments made in the course of generating assessable income are deductible while those that are capital or private in nature are not. The tax law after this point becomes very detailed and while I find it interesting, I know it bores almost everyone else. That said, our general principle is sufficient to get us by in most circumstances. I will however add one caveat; there are some deductions which fit the general rule but are specifically disallowed by the tax law. The best way to explain this is to go through some examples.

Let’s say that you have a mobile phone that you use for calling friends, texting and facebook. Obviously this is private usage, so your phone bill would not be a tax deduction. However, if you are a sales rep and you use your phone to keep in touch with clients, then your phone bill would be a tax deduction (or at least the portion you used it for business usage).

Let’s say that, as a sales rep still, you drive your car from the office to client appointments frequently. This usage of your car again helps you to earn assessable income so would be deductible. Driving your car to pick up the kids or travel on an interstate road trip is not tax deductible given it’s private. So far so good.

What about driving to and from work? It certainly helps you to earn assessable income (if you didn’t go to work then you would be unemployed!). In this case, the tax office has ruled that this travel is considered private and not tax deductible. And this is one of those cases of special exemption.

I think that’s enough to give you a taste without making you accountants or boring you to death. Needless to say, there are countless more examples and many more that get very contentious. Accountants have to do *something* right?

### The employee dilemma

So, we know have a general understanding of how deductions work but there is a problem I’ve been avoiding; majority of people are employees. It sucks, but it’s true, as an employee your employer is more likely to provide you with everything you need to do your job so you don’t have to incur the expense yourself. Why does your employer do this? It’s certainly not generosity. Why, they want the tax deduction for themselves!

So as a sales rep, you would be provided with a phone, a car, a corporate credit card, a laptop and basically anything else you needed to win clients and business. Every single one of those expenses becomes a tax deductible expense for the business. Meanwhile, you earn a salary (also a tax deduction for the business) but don’t really need to spend anything to generate that income. And so your opportunity for claiming deductions is reduced.

Some things will still remain as allowable deductions for employees &#8211; work specific or protective clothing, tools of trade, professional memberships, home office expenses, self education expenses etc. But these are fairly specific categories with strict or special rules on how they are applied.

### Investment opportunities

Investing does open up some more doors to you in regards to deductions. If you think about it, you are essentially carrying on a business of investing and so you have more flexibility in how you handle your accounting. Investing gives you the ability to take back some control.

Commonly, investing in shares allows you to claim a deduction for any brokerage charges or trading expenses (stock market data, stock trading seminars etc.). You have to be careful though because if you are not classified as a “trader” by the ATO, then you fall under the capital gains tax provisions instead of income tax provisions. The principles are similar but the application and consequences differ. Needless to say, additional tax planning strategies are available to you through share investing.

The same is true for property investments. Rent is your assessable income, but in order to generate that income you needed to pay interest to the bank, rates to the local council and don’t forget depreciation of your property and chattels. Again, the ins and outs are too complex for our discussion here but you get the idea.

If you are investing, you should seek professional tax advice to make sure you are structuring your investments in the most tax effective way. However (and lots of people make this mistake), don’t simply invest **for** a tax benefit. Make a sound financial investment and then figure out how you can get the optimal tax treatment. Making a bad investment just for a tax benefit is stupid and will just cost you money (but probably make your accountant rich).

### Another perspective

I’ve had this kind of discussion a number of times with all sorts of people. When we think about tax planning, everyone’s first thought is to deductions. It makes sense since we are all told that this is how you reduce your assessable income and lower your tax bill. But is it really worth it?

Deductions rely on you incurring an expense which helps you to earn your assessable income. But are you incurring the expense just so you can gain a deduction or a tax advantage? Surprisingly, lots of people do (or try to). The way I see it, if you don’t have any expenses, and therefore no deductions, then that’s great since you have had full access to your income. There’s no point being paid a big salary if you end up spending half of it on work related expenses. Your employer is actually doing you a favour by paying you your true salary and making sure you don’t have any work related expenses to reduce that salary.

I say that they are doing you a favour, and that may be a little bit of a stretch, but, for the most part, if you are an employee who simply earns a salary then you can prepare and submit your tax return yourself. And since the advent of e-tax you can do it quickly, easily and know that you are getting the right answer. So in a way, your employer is saving you the cost of seeing an accountant.

Okay, I probably haven’t convinced you on that last point &#8211; I’m not really sure I convinced myself. But sometimes it is good to look at the problem from another angle and consider what it would be like if you did have lots of deductions. Personally I think it would be a pain. You could always try it out first hand by starting work as a contractor instead of an employee.
