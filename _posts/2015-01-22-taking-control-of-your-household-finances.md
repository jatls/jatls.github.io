How are your financial resolutions faring so far this year? I know many people have difficulty getting  their personal finances under control and properly managed, and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-21/how-to-take-control-of-your-household-finances-in-2015/6031970" target="_blank">the national statistics on our spending and debt seems to support that</a>.

Later on in that same article, there is an important tip on the road to financial control &#8211; tracking your spending.

[blockquote]

Before you can take control of your money you need to know where it&#8217;s going.

A simple way to find out is to keep a journal of what you spend. You&#8217;ll need to be disciplined and the time period will need to be long enough to capture all your spending (with the exception of bills which roll round once a year like insurance or club memberships or even holidays).

I&#8217;d say a minimum of three months, longer if you can do it, and you need to record everything &#8211; every cup of coffee, every beer, every packet of life savers, every bus fare, every newspaper. Everything.

The journal has to be a true reflection of what you spend.

Set aside a few minutes each night to fill in your journal and, if you have a partner, try not to be judgmental about their spending. You don&#8217;t want to gain control of your money but lose your relationship along the way! The time for discussing spending habits will come later.

Tracking your spending is a great habit to get in to, particularly for successful budgeting. A budget is basically a feedback loop, with prior spending informing the provision for future spending. So it is the vital first step to taking control.
