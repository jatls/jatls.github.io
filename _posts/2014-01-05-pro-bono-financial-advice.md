Financial advice typically is sought by those people with wealth that they wish to manage or invest.  Financial counselling is typically sought by those people who have limited means, have trouble with debt and difficulty budgeting.  In fact, specific exemptions exist for financial counsellors to provide limited financial product advice is certain circumstances.  This is necessary as those people in dire need of assistance don&#8217;t have access to financial advice due to the fees.

As a contrast, lawyers engage in pro bono work as a means of giving back to the community and also ensuring that those people who perhaps couldn&#8217;t otherwise afford legal representation can still achieve justice.  I strongly believe a similar ideal should be instilled in the financial planning industry.  Even if some basic services were made available at low cost for those in need, I think the benefit to the community would be considerable.

This does two things. Firstly it increases the recognition of financial planners in the community as socially responsible professionals. Secondly, it would provide an opportunity for the financial literacy of the community to increase.  As always, this benefits advisers, firms, society and most importantly those in need of advice.

Financial counselling has a distinct role from financial planning and the work that such counsellors do is a vital community service. However, they are limited in the type of financial product advice they can provide and so, in some respects, cannot fully assist their clients to achieve their goals.
