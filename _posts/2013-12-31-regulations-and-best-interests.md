<span>The Abbott government has </span>[proposed further reforms to the financial planning regulations][1]<span>, specifically removing the Best Interest duty. This is an interesting step, particularly since the Best Interest duty has only been in force for 6 months now. It also leads me to consider what it means to be a professional.</span>

### Best Interest duty

As a quick introduction, the Best Interest duty requires that financial advisers always act in the best interest of their clients and the regulations outline how this will be tested by the courts.  Although you would assume that a professional would always act in their client’s best interest (such as a doctor ensuring their patient has the best treatment options available rather than the option which results in the greatest profit for their practice) the financial planning industry has been plagued with individuals who are concerned more with profiteering than the needs and objectives of their clients.  Part of this stems from modern financial planning practices growing out of insurance companies and many financial planners having started their careers as salespeople.

<span>Fees and remuneration were commission based rather than a flat fee for service (as is the case with other professions) and, worse, some advisers were recommending products to clients not because that product was their best option but because that product paid the highest commission or an ongoing commission to advisers &#8211; effectively providing a passive income stream.  Thankfully, this behaviour is now reduced because of strict regulations and the disclosure required around ongoing commissions is much more thorough today.  Still, there is some work to be done before the industry has fully adopted a fee-for-service model for all clients.</span>

### A case for Best Interest

<span>Like all professionals, a </span>[fiduciary duty][2]<span> exists between a financial adviser and their client.  This principle is effectively the same as a Best Interest duty so some would argue that this pre-existing legal duty is sufficient to protect clients.  The problem is that in the context of a financial planning relationship, a fiduciary duty is established when the adviser and client first engage in their planning engagement.  It may not be until after the advice has been received and implemented that the client realises that the advice received was not in their best interest and, at that stage, it would be difficult to rely on the fiduciary duty in court.  Furthermore, regarding a financial planning relationship, this has not been tested in court.</span><span><br /> </span>

<span>However, to enshrine a test in law that requires that an adviser always act in the best interest of the client and be able to prove, after the fact, that based on the client’s circumstances, needs and objectives they have provided advice in the client’s best interest means that the courts have a framework to assess a client’s claim that their best interests have not been met.  The law also provides rules to advisers which, if followed, provide “safe harbour” against any best interest claims &#8211; effectively regulating a </span>practising<span> standard.</span>

### True professionals

<span>The fundamental question that needs to be addressed by the industry is, what does it mean to be a professional?  As an industry, we need to be recognised as professionals (the same as doctors, lawyers and accountants) through demonstrable behaviours.  Through that we will be able to meet our client’s goals and, in my opinion, clients will value advice more and be willing to compensate their adviser better for that advice.</span>

<span>For too long advisers have not been seen as professionals either by the community as a whole or even within the financial planning industry.  It takes work to remove the tarnish earned through unethical and unprofessional behaviours but the rewards for clients and advisers alike are worth the effort.  And to be perfectly honest, if the industry had been acting professionally and ethically since inception then there would be no need for the government to regulate the industry further.  At this stage however, undoing the recent reforms would encourage the industry to fall back in to old habits rather than change for the better, lift standards and provide better advice.  Once the industry as a whole has shown growth and reform, then the government should consider deregulation to increase competitiveness.</span>
