I have been asked by a reader to explain interest only loans and their distinction from a “normal” loan. Here goes.

### A “normal” loan

This is the loan that you think of typically when people start talking about loans &#8211; principle and interest. Each time you make a repayment you first repay any interest charges and then a portion of the loan principle. Depending on the term will depend on the amount of principle is repaid with each payment. The reduced principle balance is then used to calculate the interest charge for the next period. Because of this, a shorter loan term will result in higher payments but lower interest charges.

### An interest only loan

As the name suggests, this loan requires that you only repay the interest charge on the loan, and not a portion of the principle. As such, your repayments will be lower but as the principle is not reducing, the repayment will remain at the same level for the term of the loan (assuming a fixed interest rate). At the conclusion of the loan term, the principle is required to be paid in full.

The graph below represents the interest charges applicable to both a principle and interest loan (grey bars) and an interest only loan (blue bars). As you can see, over the life of the loan, you pay roughly 40% more using an interest only loan.

Given that an interest only loan costs more, why do such loans exist and why would people consider using one?

### Advantages

An interest only loan has a lower repayment which is attractive particularly if you are investing in appreciating assets (such as property). You borrow the majority of the capital required to purchase the investment, you repay the bare minimum (interest only) which is hopefully funded by the income generated by your property. Then when the loan expires you can repay the principle by selling the property except in the time since the loan was established, the value of your property has increased and you have profited through the capital gain. This is a simplified explanation of property investing &#8211; but it is the essence.

Another advantage for interest only loans is for small or start up companies which need access to capital and equipment but don’t have the cash flow to make principle repayments. In this case, the interest only loan is used as a tool to manage the business’ costs.

You must also consider that the principle amount will be eroded by inflation. Although the dollar value of the loan remains constant, the purchasing power of that fixed amount decreases naturally due to inflation. In 20 years time, the principle you borrowed initially will only be worth a fraction of what it was originally. My rough calculation indicates that approximately 45% of the value of the loan would be eroded through inflation over a 20 year period (assuming inflation is stable at 3% per annum).

### Disadvantages

As explained earlier, an interest only loan will likely cost you more over the term of the loan when compared to a principle and interest equivalent.

Not only that but at the conclusion of the loan term, whilst you may have built equity in an investment, you still owe the same principle amount and often the means of repaying the principle is disposing of your investment. If your loan happened to mature during a market correction it could spell trouble for you financially.

Perhaps this shouldn’t be considered a disadvantage, but there is potential that an interest only loan could encourage borrowers to overextend their capacity to repay. If you can only just meet an interest only repayment then I would suggest careful thought and planning needs to be undertaken to ensure you can actually afford the purchase.

That’s about it. If I have missed anything or you have any other questions, please leave a comment.
