> Dear Jared, if you’re so good with money, why am I still waiting on my Batman Suit collection to be completed? I think you need to complete your own projects to end before giving advice online.

A bit of backstory first. Brendan is a die hard Batman fan and when we worked together we had a running joke that he should come to work in full Batman costume, if I paid for the costume. Just the very thought of call centre Batman screams viral video! The only problem is that the Batman costume he desires costs around $1,000 (yes, it is of itself a movie replica from the Dark Knight film).

I feel that an integrity is an important quality and we should all do our best to stay true to our word. Perhaps this is less important when words are said in jest &#8211; but let’s not nit pick too much.

The biggest concern now is that one of the “terms” of our “agreement” was that I would have to witness first hand the Batman costumed day and since Brendan and I no longer work together, this somewhat kills the deal. However, as a man of my word, I will offer him some help with how to make his Batman costume dreams come true (and perhaps in a way that will not jeopardise his job in the process).

Brendan needs to work on setting a clear savings goal. Setting a saving goal is no different from other goal setting endeavours and I encourage the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria#Developing_SMART_goals" target="_blank">SMART goals</a>. Hopefully my outline below will help Brendan in setting his goal.

#### Specific

To obtain a Dark Knight replica Batman costume for wearing at social events, costume parties, around the house and work’s casual Friday.

#### Measurable

I must save at least $1,000 to cover the cost of the costume by saving $100 per pay towards my goal.

#### Attainable

After reviewing my budget, I realise that I can cut back on other collectable toys such as Nintendo games, Mr Potato Head(s) and Dr Who merchandise and redirect this money to my Batman fund without impacting my overall budget.

#### Relevant

While most people would consider this purchase a needless frivolity, to me this is the most important thing in my life. I can die a happy man with a Batman mask on my face and a cape draped over my shoulders. I also deal with customers regularly on the phone who would appreciate me screaming down the phone [at them in Batman voice][1] in response to their inane questions.

#### Time-bound

Based on my savings plan, I expect to be the proud owner of this Batman costume in 6 months.

The last point I need to address is a tad more serious. This blog is a collection of my thoughts and attitudes towards money. I’m working to explain different personal finance concepts in a simple way so it’s not so daunting. I am specifically not providing financial advice or recommendations to people (except in regards to buying Batman costumes of course) since everyone’s personal circumstances are different and complex. If you are in doubt about your finances or need specific help, please do seek appropriate professional advice.
