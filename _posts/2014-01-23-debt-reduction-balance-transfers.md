Balance transfers can be a useful tool for managing debt (similar to consolidation loans) but there are a few tips I can provide to stop you making a mistake with them and to make sure that you get the best possible result. Like everything, if used with the right strategy, they can be very effective and help you to manage your debt more effectively.

### What is a balance transfer?

Essentially a balance transfer occurs when you apply for a new credit card and the new provider transfers a balance from a previous card or cards. Often they are offered with low or no interest rates for an introductory period (say 6-9 months) to sweeten the deal. But you must remember that nothing in life comes for free.

### Why do banks/credit providers allow this?

Given that the interest rates are lower than the actual cost of funds to the bank, you should rightly wonder why on earth they would offer this to their customers. The answer is to create business.

You don’t currently have a card with XYZ bank but they want you to. So they tell you that you get 6 months interest free on any balance transferred and you can have double or triple the limit on your current cards. Great deal! So you sign up and they send out your shiny new card and roll over all the debt from your other cards in to one and the clock starts.

Firstly, the bank knows full well that you won’t be able to repay the debt in 6 months. If you could, you probably wouldn’t find the offer attractive. Secondly, they know that you LOVE credit cards, since you have multiples already that you carry a balance on (and have difficulty repaying hence the need for a 0% loan for 6 months). These are all signs to the bank that you aren’t very good at managing your money and so they target you and tempt you to make further mistakes to help their business. Business is cut-throat!

Finally, the bank offers these deals only on their premium level cards. You know the ones &#8211; higher (comparative) interest rate, high annual fee, short repayment terms etc. These are their money spinners. Low rate cards generally don’t bring in much revenue, but your frequent flyer platinum super dooper magic-key-to-the-universe card brings in a **lot **of revenue.

So the short story is that balance transfers make banks money. And they are designed to trap you and trip you up into making financial blunders.

### So how can I beat the banks/credit provider?

Step one is to only borrow what you can repay. If you are struggling with credit card debt, another card is **not** the answer to your problems. Start by fixing your budget and controlling your spending then repay what you already have outstanding. If you have an existing credit card debt that you have the cash to repay but want to delay payment (for whatever reason) then you can use a balance transfer to your advantage.

An example of when this might be the case is you are about to travel overseas on holiday, you have an existing card with a debt that you can repay but then you wouldn’t have cash in the bank for your trip. So you transfer the balance to another card, clearing your main card for holiday purchases whilst still maintaining a bank balance in case of unexpected travel costs or emergencies.

Step two is to not use the new card for purchases until the interest free debt is paid off in full. If you put additional purchases on the card then you will start to incur interest and if you repay any money to the card it first goes to reduce the balance transfer (0% interest portion), leaving the full interest portion (maybe 25%) ticking along. So a good strategy would be to destroy the card once you have balance transferred. Once the debt is repaid in full then you can order a new one and use it as normal (responsibly).

Step three is to do what you can to avoid the monthly or annual fee. This can be difficult given discount offer transfers only apply to new customers but if you haggle with the credit provider then you can sometimes get a better deal. Remember, you actually have a lot of leverage in this situation since the bank wants to capture you as a new customer. You probably wont get away with a $0 annual fee but you may get it reduced, or some added extras thrown in. I know with my rewards card they through in bonus points that I could instantly redeem for gift vouchers equalling half of the annual fee &#8211; once the balance transfer had been processed. As I say, each offer is different so you have to do your homework.

Step four is to read *all* the fine print. Yes, it is boring and legal talk but these are the rules of your card &#8211; the contract with the bank. If you don’t read it then you don’t know your rights and you are likely to make mistakes. Knowledge is power.

### Do balance transfers negatively impact your credit rating?

I have another post planned to discuss credit reporting/ratings since there’s a lot to cover and this is already quite a long post. That said, simply applying for a new credit card and transferring a balance will not negatively impact your credit history. Having a number of balance transfers in a short period of time or in regular intervals (each six months) will impact you negatively. Your credit report tells a story about you and how you use (abuse) money. Some actions will create red flags for potential credit providers and these should be avoided if at all possible. But if you focus on managing your money well, your credit report will reflect that and tell a good story.

As I said, there’s a lot more to cover on credit reporting, so stay tuned.
