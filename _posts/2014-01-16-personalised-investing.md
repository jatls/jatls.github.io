Investing is all about risk vs reward and everyone has a different attitude towards risk. When making direct investment decisions it’s easy for you to make sure you aren’t accepting a level of risk that is greater than what you are comfortable with. But with managed investments (such as superannuation) how do you know that the investments made on your behalf meet your desired level of risk?

Your appetite for risk can be identified through your preferences and attitudes about money. Generally you complete a survey which identifies your tolerance for risk. This is a broad categorisation which can help guide you how to invest your money through managed funds. You can complete <a href="http://www.morgans.com.au/Private-Clients/My-client-account/~/media/8A2A5352D6DE413EA61AB2C6349C05C7.ashx" target="_blank">this example survey</a> to identify your risk tolerance or risk profile.

Once you know your risk tolerance you can start to develop an investment strategy tailored for your risk tolerance. It’s at this stage that you can fine tune things more to your tolerance &#8211; selecting funds that invest in property or emerging markets if you have a preference for those investment options. If you decide not to fine tune your investment strategy then most superannuation products do have options suited to the broad risk profiles.

One thing to note however is that there is no standard for risk profiling so potentially every company could give you different results. This doesn’t mean that this kind of profiling is ineffective but is instead a reflection of each company’s underlying investment strategy. I suggest doing a number of profiles with different companies to compare the results. In doing so you may find a particular fund or strategy that is well suited to you.

All that being said, there’s no right answer when it comes to investing. There’s no one single best fund or anything like that. Making the decision to invest in anything is better than not and typically the default investment choices have fairly good performance.

Diversification is important in your portfolio and I will discuss this in a later post. But in order to properly benefit from a diversified portfolio you need to understand your risk profile. This step, therefore, is fundamental to the investment process.
