Thinking about how you are going to exit from your business and planning for your retirement can be a daunting undertaking. It&#8217;s important that you seek expert advice to help you prepare and a financial adviser is a key person in your succession advisory team.

&nbsp;

#### A financial adviser will help you to clarify your retirement goals

Often we know what we want to get out of retirement and the lifestyle we desire, but don&#8217;t know the best way to get to that point. An adviser will help you through this process to work out what are your personal goals in retirement, what that means financially and then how best to achieve those goals through the succession process for your business.

When you started your business, you had a specific goal in mind and your retirement is no different. But preparing for retirement can be even more daunting than starting your own business; in part because the planning process is left too late. Once your business is established, you should be planning for the future and thinking about the timing and strategy around your exit.

#### A financial adviser will develop your objectives and timeframes to strategise your exit

Succession from your business doesn&#8217;t mean selling. In fact, in many cases, selling the business is not the ideal strategy. Once you have the end in mind and are thinking about your retirement goal, your adviser will work with you to define a clear succession plan and strategy. This will likely be implemented over a number of years and focus on the longevity of the business. After all, every business owner should aspire to have a functional and independent business they can walk away from and have it continue to grow and thrive.

Some elements your exit strategy should consider are:

  * how your business can continue to grow and earn more with less input from you
  * how long you intend to stay involved with your business
  * how to extract value from your business in a tax effective way
  * how to secure your business, your family and personal goals against the risk of your death, disability or major illness
  * how to increase the value of your business to attract investors

#### A financial adviser will support you through the transition

As you can tell, a succession plan brings together many elements in to a comprehensive strategy for you and your business. But developing the strategy is just the first step in the process. A financial adviser will work with you and your business to put your succession plan in place and check regularly that you are on track to achieve your goals &#8211; adjusting the plan as necessary.

In fact, simply having ongoing support for the business can increase the value of the business to a potential buyer. If they know that the business advisory team will continue to support the business in to the future then the certainty and continuity that provides the potential owners is invaluable.

While I have explained how financial advisers are vital to the succession planning process for your business, it&#8217;s important to mention the other professionals (accountants, lawyers, business brokers, bankers/lenders etc.) who also have a role to play in the succession of your business. By combining the skills and resources of many professionals, you can rest assured that your business and personal goals have the greatest chance of success.
