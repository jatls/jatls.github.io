Another great question. Once upon a time, the superannuation fund you had was dependant on who your employer used and you didn’t have the choice to choose. The government fixed that and now you can choose any fund that you like, but the problem now is that choice has a tendency to paralyse people. So majority of people decide to stay with their current fund anyway without assessing the options.

### Types of Fund

I’ll go through here the most common types of funds that you will come across. This is by no means an exhaustive list but the other options get more technical and generally require specific advice &#8211; like Self Managed Super Funds.

#### MySuper

The MySuper reforms are the most recent round of changes to the superannuation industry (and definitely not the last). The motivation for these funds are to simplify superannuation for the average consumer whilst providing low fees and good performance.

Most superannuation companies provide a MySuper option now and if you start with a new employer, they must use a MySuper fund as the default fund by law. So that encouraged the industry to get on board so they could continue to provide good service to companies.

One major feature of MySuper is that the investment choices are simplified. Typically they will break your investment choices down in to “life stages”. While these might not always be perfectly aligned to your investment preferences, they should produce better returns over the life of your super investment. The idea being young people cannot access their super for a long time so they should focus on higher growth options whilst those approaching retirement should take a more conservative approach. Again, this one size fits all approach is not ideal but if you don’t know about super and cannot seek financial advice, then it helps provide a more tailored approach without much effort.

#### Retail

Retail funds are your household name, corporate superannuation funds. Names like MLC, AMP, BT, Colonial First State (the list goes on for a while) spring to mind. These funds are for profit which comes in the form of fees. That said, they give the biggest range of investment options and can be personalised to you and your needs. Generally, if you seek advice from a financial planner around superannuation, they will recommend you join a retail fund.

#### Industry

Industry super funds are less well known &#8211; but have increased in prominence recently due to advertising campaigns. It may be that you know *of* industry super funds but cannot *name* a specific example.

They do have less investment options than retail funds but they are not for profit entities so typically have lower fees. They can also be restricted to employees in a particular industry although many of the larger funds are available to anyone.

### Insurance Cover

You may not know, but by default your superannuation has a level of insurance cover in case you die or become totally and permanently disabled. It’s not a very nice thing to think about, but the insurance options available in superannuation are sometimes the only protection people have. You want to make sure you have the right balance between sum insured and cost.

Most policies will have similar terms and features but will differ on price. Typically a larger fund will have access to cheaper premiums because of the scale of their operation. The cost of insurance will be disclosed in the Product Disclosure Statement of the fund and the formatting of these statements has recently been updated to better allow for direct comparison of features, benefits and cost.

Another consideration is the sum insured; too high and the cost will be prohibitive, too low and the amount will not be sufficient to meet your needs in case of tragedy. Put simply, sum up all your liabilities, think about how much you want to leave for your dependants and make an allowance for incidental costs like legal fees or funeral costs. For disability insurance you may require a different amount, particularly if you would need to make modifications to your home or require more advanced medical care. This process can take some time and it can be difficult to think about. But planning now will certainly pay dividends should the unfortunate happen.

### Management Fees

First of all, fees are not the devil. Simply because a fund has high fees does not make it a bad fund, and vice versa. Instead, you must consider the returns after adjusting for fees. For example, if you have a 10% return and a 1% fee, then your actual return is 9%. But lets say you pay 4% in fees but have a 20% return. 16% beats 9% hands down!

That said, you never know the actual performance of a fund until after the fact. It’s impossible to predict the future. So instead you look to the past and this can give you an indication as to the potential performance. Again, it’s not a crystal ball but it can give you an idea. Be careful though, just because a fund makes 30% returns one year doesn’t mean they can beat the market &#8211; they may have just got lucky. That said, past performance is the indicator used by analysts and industry experts.

If you are investigating funds yourself, try and get as much information about prospective funds as possible. Look at the fees, look at the returns, look at the insurance cover. There’s a lot to consider and the option that is best for you will be unique to you. This is the time when it pays to get the professional advice of a financial planner. This is precisely their job &#8211; to weigh up your different alternatives and recommend the best option for you. If you do hire a financial planner, make sure you pay a fee for service and that they don’t receive commissions from your super fund.

Finally, after looking at all your options, you may very well decide to stay with your current fund. That’s great! You will know that they are providing you a product that meets your needs. It also pays to regularly review funds as things change, new products are released and government rules get updated. That said, superannuation is a long term investment so swapping funds regularly might not be best for the growth of your funds. If you are still in doubt, I would suggest at the very least to ask your current fund for information about their MySuper option. You may find that, at least short term, it fits your needs until you can undergo a more formal review with a financial planner.
