This morning I saw [this article discussing how to teach children basic money skills][1] and it reminded me of a discussion I had with my sister a few weeks back about the same topic.

We discussed how when we were children, it was commonplace to see our parents actively managing money &#8211; paying bills, balancing cheque books and visiting banks. Thanks to technology and innovations, nowadays all those activities are hidden from children and many wouldn&#8217;t necessarily know exactly what expenses are incurred in running a household, for example.

That links nicely to the first point in the above article &#8211; involve your children in your daily money tasks. It might seem like a mundane chore to you but it is valuable to their financial education.

The fact that money matters are becoming more hidden from kids, also presents challenges and risks to them. Think for a minute how easy it will be for them to get a credit card and, having not had any budgeting or money management experience, watch the debt spiral out of control.

One day, I would like to run financial education seminars in schools to children 15-16 years old. I think that could have the most impact to them and they would be old enough to grasp the concepts but personally, I think financial education should start very early. As soon as kids learn to count, they should start learning about money. The reason I say that is because attitudes towards money are formed very early on. For your kids to have the skills to navigate a complex financial world, you have to start early. Intervening at 15-16 through an outreach program is only ever going to be able to do so much.
