Sure thing. The best way to think about pay day loans is as a form of bridging finance. The intention is that you borrow a small sum to cover your lifestyle expenses until your next pay cheque at which point the debt is the repaid.

Let me also say, avoid them like the plague!

Pay day loans have short terms and are unsecured debt to risky (sub prime in financial terms) borrowers. Because of this, the additional risk is compensated for with a higher interest rate. Sometimes these rates can be exorbitant to the extent of 1-2% **per day**. They can sometimes be secured against personal property, as in the case of pawn brokers.

The fundamental problem with pay day loans is that the people obtaining them don’t actually need credit, they need a budget. If you manage your money well, budget and monitor your cash flow then you will never need a pay day loan. Also, if you have a decent enough credit rating then you can usually access a credit card to cover any short term cash flow shortfalls. The added bonus of using a credit card to help smooth cash flow fluctuations is most cards come with a certain interest free period so, if used properly, costs you nothing in interest.

If you find that you are in need of a pay day loan, you should seriously assess your spending habits and budgeting because something has gone awry.
