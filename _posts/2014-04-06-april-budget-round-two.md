Today was day two of the April budget. Today involved categorising spending over the past few days and doing a quick reconciliation between the budget register and bank accounts. I also realised after categorising some expenses that they were unplanned and not budgeted for. However, I reviewed the budget and swapped funds between categories to negate any over-expenditure.

Time spent today: **20 min**  
Total time this month: **35 min**

You might be curious about the swapping of funds from one budget category to another. Let me try to explain.

An easy way to visualise your budget is like putting cash in to envelopes. Let&#8217;s say you have envelopes for rent, electricity/gas, water, groceries and savings and when you receive your pay, your cash is divided in to each envelope so it is ready for when each expense falls due.

Now, let&#8217;s also assume that there has been an increase in gas prices so your gas bill is higher than expected by $50. You have to pay your bill so you swap money from the savings envelope to cover the bill. It&#8217;s fairly straightforward and everyone does this already &#8211; budget or not.

The secret is what you do next. Majority of people see the bill paid and stop there. Instead, they should note down that savings have been depleted by $50 this pay. Then next pay, before splitting the cash across all the envelopes, the savings envelopeÂ **must** be topped up to get back to its original balance. This means that you will have a little less to allocate to your other envelopes but your savings will be in tact and your bills will be paid.

People think that a budget is a fixed, rigid schema for how to spend money. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s a plan for how you expect to spend your money. And as things change, plans have to change and adapt to the new circumstances. A rigid plan will never succeed but a flexible plan will.
