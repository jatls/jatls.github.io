Too many finance and money blogs are US-centric meaning much of the information and advice is not particularly relevant to an overseas audience.  Even some of the general advice given is of little use for those not living and working in the US.  If you want proof, refer to the TED video previously posted here discussing about saving regimes.  The behavioural finance message is important and one of the reasons I posted the video but the speaker is inevitably discussing 401k plans which, in comparison to Australia’s superannuation regime, is not as effective or universal.

In this blog, I want to provide an Australian perspective to help inform and educate people in Australia specifically.  As I have mentioned previously, I am passionate about increasing financial literacy in the community and the biggest roadblock currently is the American focus for a lot of information.

### Superannuation

In Australia, we are lucky to have a government mandated compulsory superannuation scheme, where employers must pay 9.25% of an employees gross salary to the superannuation fund of their choice.  This amount is also due to increase to 12% over coming years, however due to the recent change of federal government, the increase has been pushed back.  Any contributions made by the employer on behalf of the employee have a concessional tax rate applied; making it an attractive and tax effective environment to save for retirement.

In America, some employees have access to savings plans (401k) which have similar features, but the employee must sacrifice their wages in order to make this saving.  Furthermore, not every employee has access to these schemes as employers are not mandated to make contributions by the government.  This means that the process of saving for retirement in Australia is very different to our American counterparts.

### Retirement Savings

As a rough rule of thumb, it is recommended you save at least 15% of your income to provide for your living expenses when you retire. Given that 9.25% is already covered through the superannuation guarantee, you only need to make up the shortfall of 5.75%. Once the minimum employer contribution increases to 12%, your personal saving rate can therefore be lower.

As you can see though, simply relying on the mandated superannuation contributions will not provide you with sufficient resources to be comfortable in retirement. In order to be comfortable in retirement you will also need to make save, invest and grow wealth (either inside or outside superannuation). The government has taken steps on your behalf to help secure your retirement but the onus is still with you to provide for a comfortable retirement.

If you want to understand some strategies for increasing retirement savings online, and you live in Australia, your options are limited. I am hoping to be able to provide another avenue to discuss and investigate various options for retirement savings (and meeting other financial goals) with an Australian focus. I also hope that there will still be benefits for foreign readers too and I will make an effort to highlight if a particular strategy discussed is dependent on the Australian rules or market.
