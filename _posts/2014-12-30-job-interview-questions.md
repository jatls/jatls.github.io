I often see articles featuring difficult or interesting job interview questions. I&#8217;m fascinated by those questions as it gives insight in to the minds of top executives and the qualities they look for in staff. It also gives some hints at their vision for their company and their overall leadership vision.

I had to repost this one as it completely turns the traditional job interview on its head &#8211; challenging the applicant to speak to their strengths and letting the interviewer deciding if that person is a good fit. For talented interviewees, typical questions can be gamed and may lead to the wrong person being hired. But simply by changing the focus of the interview to be more discussion based, this can be avoided.

Obviously, job seekers and employees need to make sure their interview skills are up to par in order to remain competitive in the job market. But employers and interviewers also need to keep up to date to ensure they are hiring the best possible candidates. I think small businesses often struggle with interviewing and hiring staff simply due to the dynamics of small business. Having a few questions like this to guide a conversation around the candidate and what they can bring to the business is vital for making the best decision for the business.
