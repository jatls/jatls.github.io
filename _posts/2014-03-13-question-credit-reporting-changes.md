> Life hacker mentioned new credit reporting rules meaning late bill payments could ruin my credit rating and prevent me from getting a home loan later. Is this true?

I saw that <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/03/why-new-credit-reporting-rules-mean-late-bill-payments-could-ruin-your-life/" target="_blank">post on lifehacker</a> recently but I think the headline is somewhat alarmist to drive up readership. I&#8217;ll go through an example and then compare the impacts under the old and new regime.

You are paid fortnightly by your employer but your electricity bill is issued quarterly. For one reason or another you don&#8217;t have the money set aside for this bill and you must wait until your next pay cheque to arrive before you can make payment. This can be problematic since the due date for the bill doesn&#8217;t often align with your pay cheque.

Forgetting any budgeting advice for a moment, you really have no other option than to pay this bill late. It happens all the time to lots of people and is nothing to fret about. You call your power company, ask for an extension for a week until you get paid, and they agree (much to your relief) to grant an extension for a week. Phew!

But what has actually happened to the power companies billing system? Nothing at all. Their systems are designed to send out reminders after 30 days, demand letters after 60 days and only then start looking at other options (like cutting off your power). I&#8217;ve heard anecdotes about people who have unpaid power bills going back 18 months with seemingly no impact on their day to day life. Obviously this is extreme and I am by no means encouraging you to beÂ *this* late. But it&#8217;s important to know the system and that when you call for an extension, you are simply doing the company a courtesy so they can note it on their end. Also note you are missing out on discounts for early or on time payment &#8211; some companies up to 10% or 15% of your bill.

Under the old credit reporting system, it was at the 60 day mark that a &#8220;black mark&#8221; would be recorded on your credit file. This means, as long as you paid your bills prior to the 60 days, you would have no ill effect on your credit score. While this is great for consumers, it means that their credit file doesn&#8217;t accurately report their true repayment habits.

Under the new credit reporting system, you still have until day 60 before you get a &#8220;black mark&#8221; but the provider will also report your repayment history. Do you pay on time or are you a week late? Are you 3 weeks late? Is it a one off occurrence or is it regular? These are the types of questions this information will answer. Remember, this is not just for credit (loans and credit cards) but also utilities, phone companies, internet service providers, basically anyone who sends you a bill.

The changes also mean that credit providers will show how much credit is available to you (particularly for loans or credit cards). Other providers can then use this to assess your capacity for further debt and also cross check against your application to see you have been honest in your disclosure.

So, to your question, will the late payment of a bill kill your chance of getting a home loan? No &#8211; probably not. As I have mentioned before, your credit file is designed to tell a story about how you manage your money. These changes just make the story more descriptive. Your job is to make sure that the story it tells is the best possible story. To have some bills showing as paid a few days or a week late can easily be justified if your pay cycle doesn&#8217;t align &#8211; creditors will accept that.

Lending people money as a business is all about managing risk. The biggest risk is that you are lending to people who wont pay you back because they physically don&#8217;t have the resources to do it. The risk of late payment can be mitigated by creditors through the use of direct debits or repayment schedules aligned with your pay date. Mortgages for example will encourage you to have your pay paid directly to your mortgage offset account which saves you on interest and the bank on risk.

I personally think however that smart budgeting is the best way to manage your money and keep your credit file healthy. If you budget in the right way, you will not worry about getting a large bill on an off pay week but instead just take it in your stride and pay it when it&#8217;s due (think of that 10% to 15% discount). If you need direct help with budgeting, please [get in touch][1].

Finally, the fact that you are asking these questions and concerned about your credit file shows that you are a responsible and careful individual. You are not fiscally irresponsible even if you could manage things better or differently. This fact alone is attractive to creditors &#8211; if they lend you money then you will feel responsible and guilty if you don&#8217;t make repayment. That&#8217;s a good risk for them to take.
