I have been fascinated by money ever since I was a child.  I remember having conversations with my dad when I was nine about investing and building wealth.  Throughout high school I studied money and finance at every opportunity.  When our English class had “free reading” I would read books like The Richest Man In Babylon.  I’m still fascinated by money to this day and still want to understand all its secrets.

As a boy, I dreamt about being rich.  Ridiculously rich.  I plotted how I would get there and I dreamed about what I would do once there.  In grade 5, we had an assignment to spend a million dollars (a look at large numbers).  And in 1995, a million dollars was worth a lot more than it is today.  It turns out that after “spending” my million dollars I would have had three million by the time I graduated primary school.  So believe me when I say making money is child’s play.  But let’s face it, give anyone a million dollars to invest (only invest, no shopping) and chances are it will grow &#8211; even in the bank.

This made me wonder how two people can set out in life from exactly the same point and then end up with vastly different amounts of wealth by retirement.  Even with compounding growth and higher investment returns, that alone doesn’t account for the discrepancy.  There was another factor that took me a while to discover but it is the fundamental difference between the rich and the non-rich<sup>1</sup>.

### Understanding the true nature of money

We measure the world in dollars.  Before we invented dollars we traded by bartering with each other.  But barter has some problems and can actually stifle economic growth, so instead we use money to facilitate exchange.

In the early days of money, coins were made of precious metals and their value was represented by the metals that made up the coin.  As an aside, the reason modern coins have ridges on the edge is so you can notice if the coin has been shaved down &#8211; a throwback to when you could shave each of your coins slightly, still pass it at face value and also have a growing stockpile of precious metals.  These days money is minted of cheaper alloys and the metals that make up the coins cost far less than the face value of the coin<sup>2</sup>, but still money is treated like a rare antique.

***The rich man knows that money is a tool, not a precious thing.***

We tend to be competitive creatures where we obsess over being better than the other guy. Amusingly, growing up, our next door neighbours were the Jones family.  Needless to say there was an easy way out if people ever suggested my parents were keeping up with the Jones&#8217;.  The fact we have so many clichés to describe our competitiveness (particularly in relation to money) says it all.

We use money as a yard stick to compare against everything else, but in doing so, we start to think that we can measure value with money.  We are conditioned to think that success is a giant pile of money and the pile should be flaunted to others so they can recognise your greatness.  I&#8217;m sure everyone has experienced this, if only in a game of Monopoly.

***The rich man knows that money is just a number, not a trophy.***

Money moves in strange ways.  Economists love to study how money moves and where it goes, to the point where they describe an economy as a money multiplier.  Spend a dollar, watch it travel through the economy touching different people, and measure the impact of that dollar on overall economic growth. Let&#8217;s just say, it ends up being more than one dollar worth.

Economics also tells us that life is a series of trade-offs.  We must decide how we want to use our money since, once we have used it on one option, it is no longer available for the others.  From this point of view, everyone is trying to get rid of all their money. Even saving is just regarded as deferred spending.

***The rich man knows that money is recyclable, not disposable.***

The difference between the rich and non-rich is not their bank balance but their understanding that money is an abstract concept.  There are plenty of examples of a rich man with no money and a poor man with lots.  But what makes the rich man truly rich is his knowledge that you can only hold coins in your hand, not money.

Hopefully my three maxims above help expand your thoughts about money and help you to grow just a little richer.

>   1. I use non-rich instead of poor since there is such a negative connotation associated with the word poor.
>   2. Actually, this is only half true.  Some coins have been taken out of circulation for the fact that the metals used to produce them cost more than the face value of the coin &#8211; think 1 and 2 cent pieces in Australia.  A similar debate is currently under way regarding 5 cent pieces also but those coins are only more expensive after factoring in minting and distribution costs.
