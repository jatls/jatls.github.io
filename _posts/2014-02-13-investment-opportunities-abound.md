It’s funny that this question was asked today, since I already had this post in mind.

My initial inspiration was my recent game of cash flow. It came up during the game that the investment opportunities were overly simplified to make the mechanics of the game operate properly. I had previously considered this idea in a lot of detail since you are never presented with a little card offering you an excellent investment opportunity in real life. In the game, it is presumed that you are a) looking for investment opportunities and b) have the financial acumen to analyse the investments to distil the key facts to allow you to make your investment choice. Most people do neither of these things but I suppose it is more because of the latter the dissuades people from the former.

If you have played Cash Flow 101 you should know that each investment opportunity in the game is dependant on a couple of key facts, upon which you can make a smart investment decision. Everything else is just fluff. Real life is much the same although the metrics you choose are your own.

The reason the above question is so interesting is because the answer is already known to anonymous, and to you too my dear reader. The question should not be “what investments should I be looking for?”, but instead, “how do I decide which investment to choose?”.

Technically, an investment is “<span>the action or process of investing money for profit” and can literally be anything that will earn you a profit. However, we can categorise investments broadly as follows:</span>

  * <span>Cash (including Fixed Interest)</span>
  * <span>Shares</span>
  * <span>Property</span>
  * <span>Other</span>

<span>Investment opportunities could fall in to any of these categories. I spoke briefly about property investment recently (and there is more to come) and I hope to write more about other investment options going forward. What I wanted to focus on here though is more about making the decision between competing investments. After all, you are probably already invested in cash; you just might not be earning a very good return from it.</span>

<span>It’s important to remember that I am only going through a couple of the available metrics. There are lots to choose from and it is good to use a multitude when investing. That said, it is sometimes better to take a few measures and apply them rather than trying to understand <em>all</em> available metrics since by the time you have reached a conclusion, the opportunity would have passed. Also, the metrics simply produce a number, it is the understanding and interpretation of that number which is important. And I have a lot more to say about that too.</span>

### <span>Return on Investment</span>

<span>Return on Investment (ROI) is a good metric to compare various investments. It is simply the ratio of profit to cost. I invest $100 in a bank account and receive $4 at the end of one year after fees and taxes. My ROI is 4% (4 divided by 100). The same numbers would apply no matter what the investment.</span>

### <span>Cash-on-Cash Return</span>

<span>Cash-on-Cash Return is similar to ROI but is used primarily for geared investments. The reason being is it adjusts your return based on the amount of leverage you have used. So, you calculate this by taking your annual cash income divided by your cash investment. For example, I buy an investment property for $500,000 but I only use $50,000 of my own money &#8211; the rest borrowed from the bank. Each year, I earn $10,000 profit from the property meaning a 20% cash on cash return. If you calculated ROI, you would get only 2% which would seem less attractive than cash especially when you also factor in risk.</span>

### <span>Internal Rate of Return (Effective Rate)</span>

This one is a little trickier, but I’ll do my best to explain. Think of a particular investment as a series of cash flows, with the initial cash flow being negative (your investment now) and then a payment (or series of repayments) in the future. As those payments are received through time, an adjustment must be made to allow for the [time value of money][1], called discounting since the value will be lower than the actual amount received.

The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the percentage rate required to make your series of discounted cash flows equal zero. Then you can compare this rate with your required rate to decide if the investment is worthwhile. The same process is used to calculate the effective interest rate you see advertised with loans or credit cards. By calculating the IRR  you can also quickly and easily compare different investments, with different time horizons and even different initial investment amounts. It can be a very useful and powerful tool. And these days, spreadsheets and computers make calculating this kind of thing easy. In fact, my pocket calculator can calculate IRR in a pinch.

So as you can see, analysing investments is vital to prudent investment decisions and I would argue that it is in fact more important than picking the “right” investment option. The key is that you are looking for opportunities and that you assess them properly when they arise. In practice however, we tend to focus and specialise. You can make just as much money from futures trading, ordinary shares, investment properties or precious metals. The key is in your analysis of the investment and if you learn how to analyse companies and invest in shares, then stick with that investment class.

As I said, this is just a brief overview of some metrics to illustrate my point and I hope to go through some more metrics like this in the future. If you are serious about investing in a particular option, then do as much research as you can to feel comfortable in understanding the key metrics for that investment. And trust me, there’s lots of information available for every possible investment.

Finally, if you are really struggling to choose an investment option, pick one that *speaks* to you. Some people just *feel* that property is right for them, others shares. Follow your instincts, do some research and start investing.
