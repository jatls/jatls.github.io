> What are the available options for investing at the moment? I’m hesitant about property after the negative gearing explanation! I’ve heard shares are fairly easy to get into &#8211; is it worth the effort over a savings account?

Yesterday, we discussed investment opportunities and the financial measures you can employ to help you decide which investment to choose. I received this question around the same time and the two are fairly closely linked but I thought this would be a good time to look at the different investments around and what each of them is exactly.

### Cash

Obviously we know about this one since we all have bank accounts. Fixed Interest investments can also fall under the cash category (think term deposits). Typically cash is the most liquid of investments, has the lowest risk but also has lower returns.

When we talk about liquidity, we are referring to how readily and easily you can redeem your investment. With cash, you simply make a withdrawal and you instantly get your money.

### Shares

When I say shares, you probably think about the stock market, big corporations and household names. BHP, the big banks, large retail chains etc. But a share investment can be many different things.

Essentially a share (or stock) represents ownership in a company. Big or small doesn’t matter. Small business owners probably own shares or perhaps the only share for their company. We associate the stock market and share investments together because of the media but often forget the other ways share investments can pop up.

Derivatives would also fall under the category of shares. As the name suggests, a derivative is as an investment based on another underlying investment and commonly used to describe stock options. Basically, instead of investing in the company, by buying shares, you invest in promises or agreements linked to that stock. Investing in derivatives can be profitable but also risky and complicated. I would recommend testing the waters with shares first and then have a play with some derivatives as you learn more about the market.

Shares as an investment, typically, are medium to high risk/return and medium in liquidity terms. Risk wise, blue chip stocks will be less risky than small start ups or shares in emerging markets. Liquidity wise, to redeem your shares you have to sell them on the open market and if no one is buying, then you can get stuck but typically not for very long.

### Property

Property doesn’t just mean residential rental property but also includes commercial property (think shops and offices), industrial property (think factories) and property securities. Typically property is higher risk/return and low liquidity given that you have an appreciating asset that produces a decent amount of passive income but selling a house can take up to 90 days in settlement alone.

Property securities aim to reduce the risk and tackle the liquidity problem by taking large property acquisitions such as office buildings, shopping centres, large apartments etc. and using the investment money from a large pool of investors to fund the purchase. They’re similar to shares in many ways and if you are interested in property investment but don’t have the capital to purchase an investment property outright, have a look into some property trusts.

### Other

Other investments are anything else that doesn’t fall into the above categories. I can’t really generalise about these investments but I would suggest that the risk/return relationship would be quite high. The only reason I say that is the above categories cover all the popular or common investment options except for the highly speculative ones. If you are looking at an investment like this, be careful, do your homework, speak to your friends/family and seek professional advice. Speculative investments can be profitable but with greater returns comes greater risk.

### And …

I’m a little disappointed that my negative gearing explanation has put you off the idea of property investment. I’d be interested to know more about why you feel that way, and maybe I can help change your mind. Personally, I think investing in property is a great option and, when done right, can be very profitable with minimal effort and, for the most part, can be funded by other people &#8211; either through debt or tax incentives.

Shares are very easy to invest in these days. With discount online brokers, you can sign up right now and start trading &#8211; often with a brokerage fee of around $15-$30 depending on who you use. With shares, the first decision you must make is whether you want to invest (i.e. assess a companies fundamentals and buy into that company for the long term) or trade (i.e. analyse short term price fluctuations and buy/sell to profit off those movements). Both are equally valid options but require different skills and strategies.

If you are just starting down your share investment journey, start with fundamental analysis and invest for the long term. I personally think it is easier to be successful and time is on your side. Remember that your superannuation fund does this too, just on a larger scale.

I would recommend any books written by Warren Buffett as he is a great teacher of fundamental analysis and has made truckloads of money this way &#8211; so you know it works! Even if you invested in shares that performed at the market average over the last year, you would have earned 20% on your money compared to the cash rate of 2.5%. And if you follow a Buffett strategy, you find companies that are trading at less than their *true* value so your returns will likely be greater than average.

Also, Buffett’s books do cover (in depth) the analysis of companies and their fundamentals &#8211; as do lots of others on fundamental share investing. So to tie this to my last post, such books would be a great place to start so you can decide which companies to buy.
