You may not know but Westpac operate a financial education institution, the <a href="https://www.davidsoninstitute.edu.au/about" target="_blank">Davidson Institute</a>. They offer a wide range of financial educational resources and host short courses and webinars that are available to the public.

They are hosting their first <a href="https://www.davidsoninstitute.edu.au/learning-centre/personal/webinars/budget-basics-webinar" target="_blank">webinar on Personal Budgeting</a> in April although they do cycle through their free webinars regularly if you miss this one. Registration is free and the content promises to be clear, concise and well delivered by their professional facilitators.

I have attended similar webinars from these guys in the past and they are top quality and valuable resources &#8211; even if only a good place to start.
