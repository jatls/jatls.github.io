So I&#8217;m catching up on some reading tonight and come across two related articles. The first talks about how <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/11/money-advice-the-experts-dont-agree-on-being-frugal/" target="_blank">financial experts disagree about whether frugality is beneficial and looks at some of the alternative approaches to being frugal</a>. The second is a news article reporting that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-23/outer-melbourne-households-struggling-to-pay-for-bills-and-food/5899852" target="_blank">some households in Melbourne&#8217;s suburbs are under so much financial strain that they have times when they are financially unable to put food on the table</a>. Somewhat ironic that I read one after the other; although obviously each is targeting a different audience.

The sad part is that our modern lifestyle makes particular demands of us which many people find difficult to avoid. For example, majority of people these days have a mobile phone. And not just a simple phone for emergency calls but a smartphone with all the bells and whistles and (the worst part) a 2 year contract locking them in, not only to a fixed monthly cost but the perpetual upgrade cycle that comes with modern technology. I&#8217;m not saying that having the latest mobile phone is the worst thing in the world but it is a lifestyle *choice*. Only we seem to have forgotten that.

Most people think of frugality as giving up or going without in order to save money. I think there is an argument to be made about cutting back and simplifying life but it certainly isn&#8217;t for everyone. And the biggest problem for the &#8220;frugal movement&#8221; is the hard-core who push saving money to often uncomfortable extremes that just turn people off. Like one sheet of toilet paper per visit. No. Nope. Never. Not happening.

I instead follow a few simple rules to help to try an live within our means.

  1. **Work out your needs and wants.** It sounds simple but is actually quite hard. The easiest way to do this is to literally brain storm *everything *you could possibly want to spend money on. Assume you have infinite cash and then prioritise your list. Once you have your priorities in order then work your way down the list until you run out of available money. Job done.
  2. **Make your money work &#8230; really hard.** Think of your personal finances like a business. Each year, the budget gets tighter and efficiencies need to be found to get more done with less. If you can trim some money out of your spending through efficiencies, do it and reap the rewards. You can&#8217;t always do this, but you should be constantly wanting your hard earned cash to work for you &#8211; not sit around being lazy.
  3. **Boost your income if and when possible.** Don&#8217;t forget about your lifestyle, but if you can pick up extra work without too much of an impact on your family life then go for it. Even better, if you can invest to generate passive income, take those opportunities. More income, combined with your efficiencies above, means you can work further down your needs/wants list.
  4. **Constantly review.** This is a budgeting tip that I bang on a lot about. Track everything and go over it regularly. Monitor what you spent, how much it was and why. Take control of your spending and track your money. If you feel bad spending $3,000 a year on coffee that should tell you something. Also, as part of your review, make sure you compare your actual spending to the needs/wants list. If you have no money at the end of each month but you have met all your needs/wants then you will be very happy. Problems arise when there is a mismatch between what we want to spend money on and what we actually spend money on.

So while I feel bad for those people in our community who are unable to pay for their most basic needs, I wonder if they are instead being pressured through society to have a particular lifestyle rather than living within their means and sticking closely to their priorities. For those people who are in stress with their bills, I strongly suggest seeking advice from a financial counsellor. There is always a way to get what you want, but often times it will mean some tough decisions need to be made. If you aren&#8217;t in financial stress, it&#8217;s still important that you assess your priorities and finances so you can avoid common traps and the allure of a particular lifestyle.
