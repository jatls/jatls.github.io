The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) posits that in an efficient market, prices are a reflection of all available information for the assets traded within that market.  In a perfectly efficient market, prices change immediately as and when new information becomes available.  It is theoretically impossible in such a market for any participant to obtain a pricing advantage as prices would adjust before any new information could be acted upon by a participant.

In the development of the theory, three forms of efficient market emerged being weak form, semi-strong form and strong form.  Under strong form EMH, all information relevant to a firm or asset is priced by the market, including information internal to the firm.  It is this theory which provides a foundation for regulations that prohibit and prevent insider trading although is difficult to demonstrate empirically.

Semi-strong EMH is easier to demonstrate in real world markets as this version states that any publicly available information will be priced by the market.  This includes fundamental analysis of firms and their financials and also technical analysis of prices including charting.  It is semi-strong EMH that explains why stock prices adjust when firms make announcements about earnings and profit at the end of each financial year and implies that you cannot profit from acting upon this fundamental information.

Weak form EMH suggests that the market prices assets based on technical analysis of historical prices, trading volumes and charting.  This suggests that an advantage cannot be gained by analysing price charts for signals since any such signals would have been acted upon already.

If you saw a news report about a company you hold shares in and the market followed a weak form EMH you could obtain a price advantage with this information.  Under weak form EMH, the market would take time to price this news and you could implement a strategy to profit from this additional information.

Under either strong or semi-strong EMH, you would be unable to profit from the additional information since the current price would already incorporate the ‘new’ information.  In this case, the information in the news article is only new information to you.  And even if you were to assume that you received that information at the same time as every other market participant, by the time your trade was actioned prices would have already adjusted accordingly.

If you received a stock tip from a friend, again, the action you take will depend on the efficiency of the market.  Under weak form EMH you have potential to profit but under the stronger forms you do not.  There is potential though that the information you receive is not public information but is actually inside information.  If the information has not yet been released publically then there is a potential to profit in all but a strong form EMH market.  It is also worthwhile noting that insider trading is illegal in developed markets due to the advantages such information provides to its holders.  Empirically though, it has been shown that just prior to major company announcements, there is some information leakage and, therefore, movement in prices prior to the public release of the information.

Generally, stock markets such as the ASX and NYSE have sufficient regulatory frameworks, trading volumes and market participants to allow for semi-strong efficient markets.  Therefore market participants are unable to gain a price advantage through technical or fundamental analysis of firms or stocks.  No market is perfect though and some opportunities to exploit over or under pricing in the market are available should a participant be able to conduct sufficient research.  Usually though, it is fund managers and analysis who conduct this research on behalf of large institutional investors who will act on any advantage and, in doing so, force a price adjustment.  After that, further research will be required to obtain another advantage and as the opportunities reduce, the task of finding those opportunities becomes more difficult.  In a way though, it is the exploiting of pricing errors that helps ensure market efficiency in a similar way that arbitrage maintains equilibrium.
