> Thank you for your explanation of the options for investing! I was hesitant about the negative gearing for a few reasons: you mentioned potentially paying $1 for a 50c tax saving, which is still money out of your pocket, and also the potential for tax laws to change and the uncertainty of relying on tax concessions. I see, though, that with a professional accountant, it could be profitable in/with the right hands/advice.

A good way to increase your understanding of residential property investment is to look for properties and then analyse their investment potential. <a href="http://www.investmentpropertycalculator.com.au/free-investment-property-calculator.html" target="_blank">This calculator</a> does a really good job of breaking down the analysis into managable chunks and prompts you so it is harder to miss a key figure/deduction. It is kept up to date with changes or updates from the ATO and gives a summary and indication of the tax effect of an investment property and the potential cash flow also.

You are very right that when undertaking a potentially complex investment, it is worthwhile getting professional advice and assistance. Not only will this provide you peace of mind by having another person review your investment opportunity, but they may also have other strategies that you hadn’t considered or even be able to provide you with additional analysis that could be used to secure mortgage finance.

Investment can be tricky, but practising on paper doesn’t cost a thing. You can analyse stocks and property yourself, make mock investment decisions and then watch the outcomes as time passes. While this will never identical to the actual outcome when you invest (given that your actions in any market place will impact the market while your paper based investing will have no impact) it will still give you a strong representation of the potential outcome. And if you make a mistake or a bad investment decision, you haven’t lost any money but can still learn the lessons. Once you are confident with your “pretend” investments, you can take the plunge and “play for keeps”.*
