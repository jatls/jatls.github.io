Compounding is the principle where interest is calculated not just on your initial capital investment but also any interest that has previously accrued. Accessing compounding growth can be very advantageous as you will see shortly however you should also note that some means of compounding give a better result than others.

### Simple interest

To calculate simple interest we multiply the investment by the interest rate.  
$100 x 5% = $5 interest

Using simple interest to calculate interest earned over time (say 5 years) we multiply our first year’s interest by the number of years. This makes sense since the interest earned in the first year doesn’t add to our principal in the second year for the next interest calculation.

### Compound interest

For simplicity sake, we will continue to use the simple interest formula. In year one we still get $5 interest under a compounding scenario. In year two the principal has increased by $5 so will slightly change the interest earned. I have included a number of years below to highlight this point.

Year 1$5.00$105.00Year 2$5.25$110.25Year 3$5.51$115.76Year 4$5.79$121.55Year 5$6.08$127.63

As you can see, even over a relatively short period, compounding results in $2.63 more interest than simple interest. In our example this is a rather trivial sum but the same principal holds true when your capital is larger or interest rates are higher.

### Exponential growth

Compounding is an example of exponential growth and there is a good anecdote to explain the power of this concept to finish on.

>   When the creator of the game of chess (in some tellings an ancient Indian Brahmin mathematician named Sessa or Sissa) showed his invention to the ruler of the country, the ruler was so pleased that he gave the inventor the right to name his prize for the invention. The man, who was very clever, asked the king this: that for the first square of the chess board, he would receive one grain of wheat (in some tellings, rice), two for the second one, four on the third one, and so forth, doubling the amount each time. The ruler, arithmetically unaware, quickly accepted the inventor’s offer, even getting offended by his perceived notion that the inventor was asking for such a low price, and ordered the treasurer to count and hand over the wheat to the inventor. However, when the treasurer took more than a week to calculate the amount of wheat, the ruler asked him for a reason for his tardiness. The treasurer then gave him the result of the calculation, and explained that it would take more than all the assets of the kingdom to give the inventor the reward. The story ends with the inventor becoming the new king. (In other variations of the story the king punishes the inventor.)
