[This article][1] was published after [Treasurer Joe Hockey mentioned the possibility of allowing first home buyers access to their superannuation balances in order to assist with their purchase][2]. The author makes a good point before he goes on a rant about how super is so expensive and how it&#8217;s all the big banks faults &#8211; whilst clearly not knowing the difference between the different fees charged under a superannuation account.

That said, the basic notion is sound; let people save their super for the future, not to support buying property. One of the reasons super exists is that predominantly, people&#8217;s principle residence is their largest asset and what they will use to fund their retirement. That is not sustainable or even feasible when you consider those same people also need a place to live. As a side note; if you want to rant about something, get on to real estate agents commissions earned when &#8220;empty nesters&#8221; downsize.

From a policy perspective, you don&#8217;t want to increase the complexity in the system. Already people are wary of financial planners because of recent scandals and the activities of some unethical individuals. By increasing the complexity of the super system you run the risk of harming those you are trying to help since more people will need to see a financial adviser in order to get the correct structures and strategies in place. But many will avoid this step because of some horror stories, bad experiences or perceived high cost of advice. Whilst those who already have a strong strategy in place will seek advice and maximise the benefit of any changes to the system &#8211; the stereotypical outcome of the &#8220;rich getting richer&#8221;.

What everyone needs to remember is that superannuation is designed as a **long** term investment. To be separate from your other assets and to benefit mostly through compounding. In an era of low interest rates and distorted asset markets, you can&#8217;t just hold your balance in cash in order to beat inflation but in a perfect world that is exactly what you would do. And at the end of the day you would have a conservative asset which has built up over your lifetime to provide for some certainty in your life. The keys here are simplicity and conservatism.

The alternative is to not have an effective super system and simply increase the retirement age to 82-83. Unfortunately I expect that the current &#8220;instant-gratification&#8221; generation will be too short sighted to see this choice exists and just take what they can now without consideration for their future.

I am not averse to change with the super system or to the broader industry. But I think it needs to be the right change, for the right reasons. And allowing people to dip in to their retirement savings to pay for their current lifestyle expenses is a dumb move that does more harm than good.
