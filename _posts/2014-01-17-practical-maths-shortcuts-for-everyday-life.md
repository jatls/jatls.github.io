[Practical Maths Shortcuts For Everyday Life][1] 

<div class="link_description">
  <p>
    When you’re considering where to invest your money and what kind of return you want to get, the Rule of 72 is a useful rough-and-ready tool.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      72/Interest Rate = Years To Double Investment
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    The Rule of 72 isn’t perfectly accurate, but it’s a useful quick starting point. Say you have $5000 and you want to place it in an investment that has a return of 10 per cent. That $5000 will double to $10000 in about 7.2 years.
