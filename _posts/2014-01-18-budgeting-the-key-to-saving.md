I’ll be the first to admit, saving is a challenge &#8211; even for the frugal and disciplined among us.  And even if you do manage to save initially, you then have to constantly resist the temptation to spend or use the savings to patch over any holes in your budget.  But what you may not know is that you are already saving money regularly without knowing it and once you realise it, you have discovered the real secret of saving.

The secret is in taxes.  When you get paid, a portion of your pay is withheld and sent to the government to cover your future tax bill.  That way you don’t get a shock at the end of the financial year when you owe a bucket load of money.  The money comes out of your pay and whatever is left over you use to cover your lifestyle expenses and if you have had an over-collection throughout the year, you get a nice refund (eventually).

So how does this help you to save?  Why, tax yourself!

Decide how much you want to save, it could be as much or as little as you want.  If you are struggling to make ends meet as it is (and so think saving is too hard) start off with a tiny amount, say $10 a week.  Over a year that’s $500 saved, plus any interest along the way.  When you decide on your amount, whatever it is, lock it in and commit to saving it for at least 12 months.  Promise yourself!

The next step is to hide it.  The reason you don’t spend your tax withholding is that you don’t have access to it.  Simple technique and we can do that too.  Open up a fee-free bank account with your bank of choice.  Hopefully it comes with a good interest rate.  Don’t sign up for online banking or at least don’t link it to your main online banking &#8211; the idea is you don’t want to see it.  Tell your bank not to send you statements or anything like that.  And you have a secret home for your savings.

If you can’t hide your money that thoroughly, just put it out of sight and in an account with at least a two day clearance time if you do want to make a withdrawal.  That way, no impulse purchases!

Finally, we have two options to get our savings in there.  The first is to ask your payroll department to split your pay as they are paying you.  The bulk they will send to your main account (as normal) and the savings amount they will send to your hidden account.  They have effectively just helped you tax yourself.  The alternative is to set up an automatic payment from your main account, once you receive your pay cheque, to the hidden account.  That works too.

A variant on this is to have the extra money put in to your mortgage if you have one (and the actual mortgage account, not just an offset to prevent that impulse spending effect).

And the final tip for an added bonus is to review your saving arrangements every time you get a pay rise.  Decide *now* how much of your pay rise you will save and how much you will benefit from.  It could be anything, but I like the 50:50 approach.  Then, next time you get a raise, you increase your automatic savings regime based on your pay rise (after tax amounts of course).

The reason this is so powerful is that it forces you to save regularly (which can be very difficult to do) and puts the money somewhere you can’t get at it.  It’s almost the same as putting all your money in a piggy bank that you can only open by breaking it.  If you can’t access your money then you think a lot more before spending it.  The other point is that we are remarkable at making ends meet and living within our means.  If we don’t have access to money (or we get paid slightly less) then we make do on what’s left over.  And unless you are saving a ridiculously high percentage of your pay, you probably won’t even notice your saving at all.

Another way to think about this is that people don’t think twice about getting a new credit card or loan.  Do they think about the ongoing interest payments?  Not usually.  But when they do have to make repayments, they do and still manage to get by on the left overs.  Sure, you might struggle a bit, but weren’t you struggling before you took out the loan too?  We know in the back of our minds that when the account reaches $0, we have to stop.

So, with all that in mind, why not start saving.  In 12 months time you could be a whole lot richer without really noticing.
