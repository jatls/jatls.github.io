Today I had to deal with some AMP staff in New Zealand. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience but given that I was dealing with international products and tax rules, I questioned everything and scrutinised more than usual. After reviewing a product statement, I read

> AMP is New Zealand&#8217;s leading provider of financial products. If you want to invest in your retirement or protect your family, please contact us.

or words to that effect. The <del>important</del> weird part was the choice of words &#8220;invest in your retirement&#8221;. Invest in?

I&#8217;ve never really thought about saving for retirement as an investment *in* retirement. Perhaps an investment *for* retirement, but not *in*! To my mind, investing in retirement means to invest money after you retire, not saving money so you can retire.

What do you think? Do you invest/save for retirement or are you investing in retirement?

How curious.
